A quick and easy way of getting inter-line space for copy-editing is
to change <code>&#x5c;baselinestretch</code>&nbsp;&mdash; <code>&#x5c;linespread</code><code>&#x7b;1.2&#x7d;</code> (or,
equivalently <code>&#x5c;renewcommand</code><code>&#x7b;<code>&#x5c;baselinestretch</code>&#x7d;</code></code><code>&#x7b;1.2&#x7d;</code>) may
be adequate.  Note that <code>&#x5c;baselinestretch</code> changes don&rsquo;t take
effect until you select a new font, so make the change in the preamble
before any font is selected.  Don&rsquo;t try changing <code>&#x5c;baselineskip</code>:
its value is reset at any size-changing command so that results will
be inconsistent.

<p>
For preference (and certainly for a production document, such as a
dissertation or an article submission), use a line-spacing package.
The only one currently supported is <i class="package">setspace</i>.
<i class="package">Setspace</i> switches off double-spacing at places where even
the most die-hard official would doubt its utility (footnotes, figure
captions, and so on); it&rsquo;s very difficult to do this consistently if
you&rsquo;re manipulating <code>&#x5c;baselinestretch</code> yourself.

<p>
(Note: do <em>not</em> be tempted by <i class="package">doublespace</i>&nbsp;&mdash; its
performance under current LaTeX is at best problematical.)

<p>
Of course, the real solution (other than for private copy editing) is
<em>not</em> to use double-spacing at all.  Universities, in particular,
have no excuse for specifying double-spacing in submitted
dissertations: LaTeX is a typesetting system, not a
typewriter-substitute, and can (properly used) make single-spaced text
even more easily readable than double-spaced typewritten text.  If you
have any influence on your university&rsquo;s system (for example, through
your dissertation supervisor), it may be worth attempting to get the
rules changed (at least to permit a &ldquo;well-designed book&rdquo; format).

<p>
Double-spaced submissions are also commonly required when submitting
papers to conferences or journals.  Fortunately (judging by the
questions from users in this author&rsquo;s department), this demand is
becoming less common.

<p>
Documentation of <i class="package">setspace</i> appears as TeX comments in the
package file itself.
