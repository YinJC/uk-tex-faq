<h1>The quality of your LaTeX</h1>


<p>

<p>
The <i class="package">l2tabu</i> tutorial (mentioned in 
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-man-latex.html">online introductions</a>) is undoubtedly a
good read.

<p>
However, it&rsquo;s always difficult to remember the things you should
<em>not</em> do, when there are so many things to remember that you
really must do: some automation is useful&hellip;.

<p>
The nicely-named <i class="package">nag</i> allows you to apply a configurable set
of checks to your document, as you run it through LaTeX; you get
messages like:
<blockquote>

<pre>
Package nag Warning: Command \bf is an old LaTeX 2.09 command. 
(nag)                Use \bfseries or \textbf instead on input line 30.
</pre>


<pre>
Package nag Warning: Command \bf is an old
                          LaTeX 2.09 command. 
(nag)                Use \bfseries or \textbf
                    instead on input line 30.
</pre>

</blockquote>

  (the package provides a demo file which contains most of the sorts
  of errors you might make&nbsp;&mdash; the example is one of them).






While <i class="package">l2tabu</i> and <i class="package">nag</i> alert you to <em>possible</em>
programming errors, you should not forget that they are merely
commenting on <em>style</em>; don&rsquo;t assume that a <i class="package">nag</i> error is
going to damn your code&nbsp;&mdash; rather, note the issue and try to train
your fingers not to do the same &ldquo;next time&rdquo;.

<p>
The <i class="progname">lacheck</i> program analyses your source and comments on
it; its view of what is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is <em>very</em> subjective (the
documentation says), but it can be useful.

<p>
There&rsquo;s also a web site
<a href="http://www.kohm.name/markus/texidate.html">TeXidate</a>
which will do a static analysis of your document (unfortunately, you
have to paste your document source into a text window).  The site
doesn&rsquo;t seem as comprehensive as <i class="package">nag</i>, but it allows you to
download its script, which you can then juggle with to make it more
draconian.
