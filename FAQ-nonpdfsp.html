<p>

<p>
This is a PDFTeX error: PDFTeX is running in PDF output

mode, and it has encountered a 
<a href="FAQ-specials.html"><code>&#x5c;special</code></a> command.  PDFTeX is
able to generate its own output, and in this mode of operation has no
need of <code>&#x5c;special</code> commands (which allow the user to pass
information to the driver being used to generate output).

<p>
Why does this happen?  LaTeX users, nowadays, hardly ever use
<code>&#x5c;special</code> commands on their own&nbsp;&mdash; they employ packages to do the
job for them.  Some packages will generate <code>&#x5c;special</code> commands
however they are invoked: <i class="package">pstricks</i> is an example (it&rsquo;s very
raison d&rsquo;\^etre is to emit PostScript code in a sequence of <code>&#x5c;special</code>
commands).  <i class="package">Pstricks</i> may be dealt with by other means (the
<i class="package">pdftricks</i> package offers a usable technique).

<p>
More amenable to correction, but more confusing, are packages (such as
<i class="package">color</i>, <i class="package">graphics</i> and <i class="package">hyperref</i>) that
specify a &ldquo;driver&rdquo;.  These packages have plug-in modules that
determine what <code>&#x5c;special</code> (or other commands) are needed to generate
any given effect: the <tt>pdftex</tt> driver for such packages knows not to
generate <code>&#x5c;special</code> commands.  In most circumstances, you can let
the system itself choose which driver you need; in this case
everything will act properly when you switch to using PDFLaTeX.  If
you&rsquo;ve been using <i class="progname">dvips</i> (and specifying the <code class="verb">dvips</code> driver)
or <i class="progname">dvipdfm</i> (for which you have to specify the driver), and
decide to try PDFLaTeX, you <em>must</em> remove the <code class="verb">dvips</code> or
<code class="verb">dvipdfm</code> driver specification from the package options, and let the
system recognise which driver is needed.
