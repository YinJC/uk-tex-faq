<p>
LaTeX itself provides a <i class="class">letter</i> document class, which is
widely disliked; the present author long since gave up trying with
it.  If you nevertheless want to try it, but are irritated by its way
of vertically-shifting a single-page letter, try the following hack:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\makeatletter
\let\@texttop\relax
\makeatother
</pre>
</blockquote>
in the preamble of your file.

<p>
Doing-it-yourself is a common strategy; Knuth (for use with
Plain TeX, in the TeXbook), and Kopka and Daly (in their Guide to
LaTeX) offer worked examples.  (The latest version of Knuth&rsquo;s
macros appear in his &ldquo;local library&rdquo; dump on the archive, which is
updated in parallel with new versions of TeX&nbsp;&mdash; so not very often&hellip;)

<p>
Nevertheless, there <em>are</em> contributed alternatives&nbsp;&mdash; in fact
there are an awfully large number of them: the following list, of
necessity, makes but a small selection.

<p>
The largest, most comprehensive, class is <i class="class">newlfm</i>; the <tt>lfm</tt>
part of the name implies that the class can create letters, faxes and
memoranda.  The documentation is voluminous, and the package seems
very flexible.

<p>
Other classes recommended for inclusion in this FAQ are
<i class="class">akletter</i> and <i class="class">isodoc</i>.

<p>
The <i class="class">dinbrief</i> class, while recommended, is only documented in
German.

<p>
There are letter classes in each of the excellent
<i class="class">KOMA-script</i> (<i class="class">scrlttr2</i>: documentation is available in
English) and <i class="package">ntgclass</i> (<i class="class">brief</i>: documentation in Dutch
only) bundles.  While these are probably good (since the bundles
themselves inspire trust) they&rsquo;ve not been specifically recommended by
any users.
