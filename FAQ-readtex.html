<p>

<p>
So you&rsquo;ve been sent an (La)TeX file: what are you going to do with
it?

<p>
You can, of course, &ldquo;just read it&rdquo;, since it&rsquo;s a plain text file;
the problem is that the markup tags in the document may prove
distracting.  Most of the time, even TeX <em>experts</em> will
typeset a (La)TeX file before attempting to read it&nbsp;[[[LBRACE]]][[[RBRACE]]]&hellip;

<p>
So you shouldn&rsquo;t be too concerned if you can&rsquo;t make head nor tail of
the file: it is designed to be read by a (sort of) compiler, and
compilers don&rsquo;t have much in common with human readers.

<p>
A possible next step is to try an on-line LaTeX editor.  There are
many of these&nbsp;&mdash; a compilation of links may be found in 
<a href="http://texblog.net/latex-link-archive/online-compiler/.html">this blog post</a>

<p>
Of that long list, the present author has only dabbled with 
<a href="https://www.writelatex.com/.html">WriteLaTeX</a>; it seems well
suited to simple &lsquo;one-shot&rsquo; use in this way.

<p>
If no online compiler helps, you need to typeset the document
&ldquo;yourself&rdquo;.  The good news is that TeX systems are available,
free, for most sorts of computer; the bad news is that you need a
pretty complete TeX system even to read a single file, and complete
TeX systems are pretty large.

<p>
TeX is a typesetting system that arose from a publishing project (see
&ldquo;<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-whatTeX.html">what is TeX</a>&rdquo;),
and its basic source is available free from its author.  However, at
its root, it is <em>just</em> a typesetting engine: even to view or to
print the typeset output, you will need ancillary programs.  In short,
you need a TeX <em>distribution</em>&nbsp;&mdash; a collection of
TeX-related programs tailored to your operating system: for details
of the sorts of things that are available, see

&ldquo;<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-TeXsystems.html">TeX distributions</a>&rdquo;
or

&ldquo;<a class="FA[[[htmlonly]]].html" href="FAQ-commercial.html">commercial TeX distributions</a>&rdquo;.

<p>
But beware&nbsp;&mdash; TeX makes no attempt to look like the sort of
WYSIWYG system you&rsquo;re probably used to (see

&ldquo;<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-notWYSIWYG.html">why is TeX not WYSIWYG</a>&rdquo;):
while many modern versions of TeX have a compile&ndash;view cycle that
rivals the best commercial word processors in its responsiveness, what
you type is usually <em>markup</em>, which typically defines a logical
(rather than a visual) view of what you want typeset.

<p>
So there&rsquo;s a balance between the simplicity of the original
(marked-up) document, which can more-or-less be read in <em>any</em>
editor, and the really rather large investment needed to install a
system to read a document &ldquo;as intended&rdquo;.

<p>
Are you &ldquo;put off&rdquo; by all this?&nbsp;&mdash; remember that TeX is good at
producing PDF: why not ask the person who sent the TeX file
to send an PDF copy?
