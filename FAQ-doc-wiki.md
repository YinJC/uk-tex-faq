title: WIKI books for TeX and friends

The _WIKI_ concept can be a boon to everyone, if used sensibly.
The ''general'' WIKI allows _anyone_ to add stuff, or to edit
stuff that someone else has added: while there is obvious potential
for chaos, there is evidence that a strong user community can keep a
WIKI under control.


Following the encouraging performance of the 
[CONTeXT WIKI](http://contextgarden.net/), valiant
efforts have been made generating ''WIKI books'' for (La)TeX
users.  Thus we have 
[(Plain) TeX WIKI book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/TeX) and 
[LaTeX WIKI book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)&nbsp;&mdash;
both well established.  Both are highly rated as reference sources,
and even as introductory texts.
