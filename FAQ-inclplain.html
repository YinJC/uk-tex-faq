<h1>Including Plain TeX files in LaTeX</h1>


<p>

<p>
LaTeX, though originally <a href="FAQ-LaTeXandPlain.html">based on Plain TeX</a>, does not
contain all of Plain TeX&rsquo;s commands.  Worse, some Plain TeX
command names appear in LaTeX, with different semantics.  As a
result, special measures need to be taken to allow general Plain TeX
documents (or parts of documents) to be typeset within LaTeX.

<p>
The truly reliable way is to translate the Plain TeX commands, to
produce an equivalent of the original&rsquo;s semantics.  However, this is
not practical in many circumstances, and for those occasions, the
<i class="package">plain</i> package will often come to your aid.  The package
defines a <code class="environment">plain</code> environment, in which a Plain TeX
document may be processed:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{plain}
  \input{plain-doc}
\end{plain}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The package is known to fail, for example, with documents that use
AMSTeX; no doubt it would also fail if asked to load Eplain.
All these things can be overcome (although it&rsquo;s not often easy), but
the environment saves a lot of work on many occasions.
