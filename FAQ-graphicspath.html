<h1>Importing graphics from &ldquo;somewhere else&rdquo;</h1>


<p>

<p>
By default, graphics commands like <code>&#x5c;includegraphics</code> look
&ldquo;wherever TeX files are found&rdquo; for the graphic file they&rsquo;re being
asked to use.  This can reduce your flexibility if you choose to hold
your graphics files in a common directory, away from your (La)TeX
sources.

<p>
The simplest solution is to patch TeX&rsquo;s path, by changing the
default path.  On most systems, the default path is taken from the
environment variable <tt>TEXINPUTS</tt>, if it&rsquo;s present; you can adapt that
to take in the path it already has, by setting the variable to
<blockquote>
<pre>
TEXINPUTS=.:<graphics path(s)>:
</pre>
</blockquote>
on a Unix system; on a Windows system the separator will be &ldquo;<tt>;</tt>&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;<tt>:</tt>&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;<tt>.</tt>&rdquo; is there to ensure
that the current directory is searched first; the trailing
&ldquo;<tt>:</tt>&rdquo; says &ldquo;patch in the value of <tt>TEXINPUTS</tt> from
your configuration file, here&rdquo;.

<p>
This method has the merit of efficiency ((La)TeX does <em>all</em> of
the searches, which is quick), but it&rsquo;s always clumsy and may prove
inconvenient to use in Windows setups (at least).

<p>
The alternative is to use the <i class="package">graphics</i> package command
<code>&#x5c;graphicspath</code>; this command is of course also available to users
of the <i class="package">graphicx</i> and the <i class="package">epsfig</i> packages.  The
syntax of <code>&#x5c;graphicspath</code>&rsquo;s one argument is slightly odd: it&rsquo;s a
sequence of paths (typically relative paths), each of which is
enclosed in braces.  A slightly odd example (slightly modified from one
given in the <i class="package">graphics</i> bundle documentation) is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\graphicspath{{eps/}{png/}}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which will search for graphics files in subdirectories <i class="filename">eps</i> and
<i class="filename">png</i> of the directory in which LaTeX is running.  (Note that
the trailing &ldquo;<tt>/</tt>&rdquo; <em>is</em> required.)

<p>
(Note that some (La)TeX systems will only allow you to use files in
the current directory and its sub-directories, for security reasons.
However, <code>&#x5c;graphicspath</code> imposes no such restriction: as far as
<em>it</em> is concerned, you can access files anywhere.)

<p>
Be aware that <code>&#x5c;graphicspath</code> does not affect the operations of
graphics macros other than those from the graphics bundle&nbsp;&mdash; in
particular, those of the outdated <i class="package">epsf</i> and
<i class="package">psfig</i> packages are immune.

<p>
The slight disadvantage of the <code>&#x5c;graphicspath</code> method is
inefficiency.  The package will call (La)TeX once for each entry in
the list to look for a file, which of course slows things.  Further,
(La)TeX remembers the name of any file it&rsquo;s asked to look up, thus
effectively losing memory, so that in the limit a document that uses a
huge number of graphical inputs could be embarrassed by lack of
memory.  (Such &ldquo;memory starvation&rdquo; is pretty unlikely with any
ordinary document in a reasonably modern (La)TeX system, but it
should be borne in mind.)

<p>
If your document is split into a variety of directories, and each
directory has its associated graphics, the <i class="package">import</i> package
may well be the thing for you; see the discussion 
in the question &ldquo;
<a href="FAQ-docotherdir.html">bits of document in other directories</a>
&rdquo;.
