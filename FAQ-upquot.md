# Realistic quotes for verbatim listings

The `cmtt` font has ''curly'' quotes,
which are pleasing on the eye, but don't really tally with what one
sees on a modern 
`xterm`.

The appearance of these quotes is critical in program listings,
particularly in those of Unix-like shell scripts.  The
[`upquote`](http://ctan.org/pkg/upquote) package modifies the behaviour of the
`verbatim` environment so that the output is a clearer
representation of what the user must type.
