<p>

<p>
A large proportion of people are satisfied with one of Patashnik&rsquo;s
original &ldquo;standard&rdquo; styles, <i class="package">plain</i>, <i class="package">unsrt</i>,
<i class="package">abbrv</i> and <i class="package">alpha</i>.  However, no style in that set
supports the &ldquo;author-date&rdquo; citation style that is popular in many
fields; but there are a very large number of contributed styles
available, that <em>do</em> support the format.

<p>
(Note that author-date styles arose because the simple and clear
citation style that <i class="package">plain</i> produces is so awkward in a
traditional manuscript preparation scenario.  However, TeX-based
document production does away with all those difficulties, leaving us
free once again to use the simple option.)

<p>
Fortunately, help is at hand, on the Web, with this problem:
<ul>
<li> a sample text, showing the sorts of style choices available, can
  be found on 





  
  <a href="http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/&nbsp;kjt/software/latex/showbst.html.html">Ken Turner&rsquo;s web site</a>;

<li> an excellent survey, that lists a huge variety of styles,
  sorted into their nominal topics as well as providing a good range
  of examples, is the Reed College 





  
  &ldquo;<a href="http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/bibtexstyles.html.html">Choosing a BibTeX style</a>&rdquo;.

</ul>

<p>
Of course, these pages don&rsquo;t cover everything; the problem the
inquisitive user faces, in fact, is to find what the various available
styles actually do.  This is best achieved (if the links above don&rsquo;t
help) by using <i class="package">xampl.bib</i> from the BibTeX documentation
distribution: one can get a pretty good feel for any style one has to
hand using this &ldquo;standard&rdquo; bibliography.  For style
<i class="package">my-style.bst</i>, the simple LaTeX document:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\bibliographystyle{my-style}
\nocite{*}
\bibliography{xampl}
\end{document}
</pre>
</blockquote>
will produce a representative sample of the citations the style will
produce.  (Because <i class="package">xampl.bib</i> is so extreme in some of its
&ldquo;examples&rdquo;, the BibTeX run will also give you an interesting
selection of BibTeX&rsquo;s error messages&hellip;)
