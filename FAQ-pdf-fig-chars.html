<p>

<p>
You have a PDF figure, which you want to use in your
PDFLaTeX document.  When you compile the document, PDFTeX
complains about &ldquo;missing glyphs&rdquo;, and some (or all) of the labelling
text or symbols in the original figure is no longer visible.

<p>
What has happened is:
<ol>
<li> Your figure file (say <i class="filename">fig.pdf</i>) has a font <i class="filename">font.pfb</i>
  embedded in it.
<li> PDFTeX notes that it has <i class="filename">font.pfb</i> on disc, and loads
  that in place of the copy in <i class="filename">fig.pdf</i>.
<li> It turns out that the copy in <i class="filename">fig.pdf</i> has glyphs that
  aren&rsquo;t in <i class="filename">font.pfb</i> on disc, so that you get errors while
  compiling and you see that characters are missing when you view the
  output.  (PDFTeX can&rsquo;t know that the fonts are different, since
  they have the same name.)
</ol>
Which is all very undesirable.

<p>
PDFTeX does this to keep file sizes down: suppose you have a
document that loads figures <i class="filename">fig1.pdf</i> and <i class="filename">fig2.pdf</i>; both
of those use font <i class="filename">font.pfb</i>.  If PDFTeX takes no action,
there will be <em>two</em> copies of <i class="filename">font.pfb</i> in the output.
(If your document also uses the font, there could be three copies.)

<p>
A real case is the URW font <i class="filename">NimbusRomNo9L-Regu</i> (a clone
of Times Roman), which is available in a version with Cyrillic
letters, while the version in TeX distributions doesn&rsquo;t have those
letters.  Both versions, as distributed, have the same name.

<p>
The simple (&ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo;) solution is to add the command
<blockquote>
  <code>&#x5c;pdfinclusioncopyfonts</code><tt>=1</tt>
</blockquote>
to the preamble of your document.

<p>
The &ldquo;real&rdquo; solution is that one or other font should be renamed.  In
either case, this would require that you reconfigure some program&rsquo;s
(TeX&rsquo;s or your drawing package&rsquo;s) font tables&nbsp;&mdash; inevitably a
tiresome job.
