<h1>&ldquo;Unknown graphics extension&rdquo;</h1>


<p>

<p>
The LaTeX graphics package deals with several different types of
DVI (or other) output drivers; each one of them has a potential
to deal with a different selection of graphics formats.  The package
therefore has to be told what graphics file types its output driver
knows about; this is usually done in the &lsaquo;<i>driver</i>&rsaquo;<code class="extension">def</code> file
corresponding to the output driver you&rsquo;re using.

<p>
The error message arises, then, if you have a graphics file whose
extension doesn&rsquo;t correspond with one your driver knows about.  Most
often, this is because you&rsquo;re being optimistic: asking
<i class="progname">dvips</i> to deal with a <code class="extension">png</code> file, or PDFTeX to deal with
a <code class="extension">eps</code> file: the solution in this case is to transform the graphics
file to a format your driver knows about.

<p>
If you happen to <em>know</em> that your device driver deals with the
format of your file, you are probably falling foul of a limitation of
the file name parsing code that the graphics package uses.  Suppose
you want to include a graphics file <i class="filename">home.bedroom.eps</i> using the
<i class="progname">dvips</i> driver; the package will conclude that your file&rsquo;s
extension is <code class="extension">bedroom.eps</code>, and will complain.

<p>
The <i class="package">grffile</i> package deals with the last problem (and
others&nbsp;&mdash; see the package documentation); using the package, you may
write:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{grffile}
...
\includegraphics{home.bedroom.eps}
</pre>
</blockquote>
or you may even write
<blockquote>
<pre>
\includegraphics{home.bedroom}
</pre>
</blockquote>
and <i class="package">graphicx</i> will find a <code class="extension">eps</code> or <code class="extension">pdf</code>
(or whatever) version, according to what version of (La)TeX you&rsquo;re
running.

<p>
If for some reason you can&rsquo;t use <i class="package">grffile</i>, you have three
unsatisfactory alternatives:
<ul>
<li> Rename the file&nbsp;&mdash; for example <i class="filename">home.bedroom.eps</i>&rarr;
  <i class="filename">home-bedroom.eps</i>
<li> Mask the first dot in the file name:
<pre>
\newcommand*{\DOT}{.}
\includegraphics{home\DOT bedroom.eps}
</pre>
<li> Tell the graphics package what the file is, by means of options
  to the <code>&#x5c;includegraphics</code> command:

<pre>
\includegraphics[type=eps,ext=.eps,
                 read=.eps]{home.bedroom}
</pre>


<pre>
\includegraphics[type=eps,ext=.eps,read=.eps]{home.bedroom}
</pre>
