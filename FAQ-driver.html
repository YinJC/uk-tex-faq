<h1>What is a DVI driver?</h1>


<p>

<p>
A DVI driver is a program that takes as input a
<a href="FAQ-dvi.html">DVI file</a>
and (usually) produces a file in a format that something <em>other</em>
than a TeX-related program can process.

<p>
A driver may be designed for producing output for printing (e.g.,
PostScript), for later processing (e.g., PostScript for inclusion in a later
document), or for document exchange (e.g., PDF).

<p>
As well as the DVI file, the driver typically also needs font
information.  Font information may be held as bitmaps or as outlines,
or simply as a set of pointers into the fonts that a printer itself
provides.  Each driver will expect the font information in a particular
form.

<p>
