[[[keywords]]][[[LBRACE]]]asterisk square bracket start line[[[RBRACE]]]

<p>
This answer concerns two sorts of problems: errors of the form
<blockquote>
<pre>
! Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again> 
                   p
<*> [perhaps]
</pre>
</blockquote>
and errors where a single asterisk at the start of a line mysteriously
fails to appear in the typeset output.

<p>
Both problems arise because <tt>&#x5c; </tt> takes optional arguments.  The
command <tt>&#x5c; *</tt> means &ldquo;break the line here, and inhibit page break
following the line break&rdquo;; the command <tt>&#x5c; [</tt>&lsaquo;<i>dimen</i>&rsaquo;<tt>]</tt>
means &ldquo;break the line here and add &lsaquo;<i>dimen</i>&rsaquo; extra vertical space
afterwards&rdquo;.

<p>
The problem arises because <tt>&#x5c; </tt> looks for the next
non-blank thing; the test it uses ignores the end of the line in
your input text, so that <tt>&#x5c; </tt> comes to imagine that you
were giving it a &lsquo;modifier&rsquo;.

<p>
An obvious solution is to enclose the stuff at the start of the new
line in braces, typing:
<blockquote>
<pre>
{\ttfamily
  /* C-language comment\\
  {[perhaps]} this could be done better\\
  {*}/
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
This particular example could be coded (without any problems) in
verbatim, but the behaviour does confuse people.

<p>
The problem also appears in maths mode, in arrays and so on.  In this
case, large-scale bracketing of things is <em>not</em> a good idea; the
TeX primitive <code>&#x5c;relax</code> (which does nothing except to block
searches of this nature) may be used.  From another
<i class="newsgroup">comp.text.tex</i> example:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{eqnarray}
  [a] &amp;=&amp; b \\
  \relax[a] &amp;=&amp; b
\end{eqnarray}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which is a usage this FAQ would not recommend, anyway: refer
to the <a href="FAQ-eqnarray.html">reason not to use <code class="environment">eqnarray</code></a>.

<p>
Note that the <i class="package">amsmath</i> package modifies the behaviour of
<tt>&#x5c; </tt> in maths.  With <i class="package">amsmath</i>, the
<code class="environment">eqnarray</code> example doesn&rsquo;t need any special action
(<code>&#x5c;relax</code> or braces).
