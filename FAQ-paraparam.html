<h1>Why does it ignore paragraph parameters?</h1>


<p>

<p>
When TeX is laying out text, it doesn&rsquo;t work from word to word, or
from line to line; the smallest complete unit it formats is the
paragraph.  The paragraph is laid down in a buffer, as it appears, and
isn&rsquo;t touched further until the end-paragraph marker is processed.
It&rsquo;s at this point that the paragraph parameters have effect; and it&rsquo;s
because of this sequence that one often makes mistakes that lead to
the paragraph parameters not doing what one would have hoped (or
expected).

<p>
Consider the following sequence of LaTeX:
<blockquote>
<pre>
{\raggedright % declaration for ragged text
Here's text to be ranged left in our output,
but it's the only such paragraph, so we now
end the group.}

Here's more that needn't be ragged...
</pre>
</blockquote>
TeX will open a group, and impose the ragged-setting parameters within
that group; it will then save a couple of sentences of text and
close the group (thus restoring the previous value of the
parameters that <code>&#x5c;raggedright</code> set).  Then TeX encounters a blank
line, which it knows to treat as a <code>&#x5c;par</code> token, so it typesets the
two sentences; but because the enclosing group has now been closed,
the parameter settings have been lost, and the paragraph will be
typeset normally.

<p>
The solution is simple: close the paragraph inside the group, so that
the setting parameters remain in place.  An appropriate way of doing
that is to replace the last three lines above with:
<blockquote>
<pre>
end the group.\par}
Here's more that needn't be ragged...
</pre>
</blockquote>
In this way, the paragraph is completed while <code>&#x5c;raggedright</code>&rsquo;s
parameters are still in force within the enclosing group.

<p>
Another alternative is to define an environment that does the
appropriate job for you.  For the above example, LaTeX already
defines an appropriate one:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{flushleft}
Here's text to be ranged left...
\end{flushleft}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In fact, there are a number of parameters for which TeX only
maintains one value per paragraph.  A tiresome one is the set of upper
case/lower case translations, which (oddly enough) constrains
hyphenation of mutilingual texts.  Another that regularly creates
confusion is <a href="FAQ-baselinepar.html"><code>&#x5c;baselineskip</code></a>.
