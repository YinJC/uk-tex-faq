<p>

<p>
&lsquo;Traditional&rsquo; approaches to the problem (of checking your spelling) were
designed to work with a plain text file; in our case, we have an (La)TeX
source.  For the user, this is a simple-to-understand way to do the
job; but for the spell-checker programmer, it requires heuristic (and
hence fallible) analysis of (La)TeX macros and so on.  The
alternative, of viewing the text <em>after</em> (La)TeX has processed
the results, is covered below.

<p>
The user of an <a href="FAQ-editors.html">shell/editor</a> will usually find it
embeds a spelling checker.  For command-line use, there are several
choices, depending on the system you&rsquo;re using.

<p>
For Unix, <i class="progname">ispell</i> was long the program of choice; it is well
integrated with <i class="progname">emacs</i>, and deals with some TeX syntax.
However, it has more-or-less been replaced everywhere, by
<i class="progname">aspell</i>, which was designed as a successor, and certainly
performs better on most metrics; there remains some question as to its
performance with (La)TeX sources.  The most recent offering (which
is widely used in other open-source software projects) is

  <a href="http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/"><i class="progname">Hunspell</i></a>.




<i class="progname">Hunspell</i> is available for other architectures, too; a web
search shows versions available for Windows, at least.

<p>
For the Macintosh, <i class="progname">Excalibur</i> has long been used; its
distribution comes with dictionaries for several languages.
<i class="progname">Hunspell</i> (see above) is actually part of OS X from version 10.6.

<p>
The VMS Pascal program <i class="progname">spell</i> makes special cases of
some important features of LaTeX syntax.

<p>
For MSDOS, there are several programs.  <i class="progname">Amspell</i> can be
called from within an editor, and <i class="progname">jspell</i> is an extended
version of <i class="progname">ispell</i>.

<p>
An alternative approach takes (La)TeX output, and checks that.  A
straightforward approach is to produce PDF output, and process
it with <i class="progname">pdftotext</i>, using any plain text checker on the
result (the checkers listed above all work in this r\^ole).  For this
to work reasonably well, the user should disable hyphenation before
making the PDF output.

<p>
The (experimental) LuaTeX/LaTeX package <i class="package">spelling</i> goes
one step further: it uses <i class="progname">lua</i> code to extract words
<em>while typesetting is going on</em>, but before hyphenation is
applied.  Each word is looked up in a list of known bad spellings, and
the word highlighted if it appears there.  In parallel, a text file is
created, which can be processed by a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; spelling checker to
produce a revised &ldquo;bad spelling&rdquo; list.  (The package documentation
shows the end result; it includes words such as &lsquo;spellling&rsquo;, which are
duly highlighted.)
