<h1>The ExTeX project</h1>


<p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.extex.org/">The ExTeX project</a> is
building on the experience of the many existing TeX development and
extension projects, to develop a new TeX-like system.  The system
is to be developed in Java (like the ill-fated NTS project).

<p>
While ExTeX will implement all of TeX&rsquo;s primitives, some may be
marked as obsolete, and &ldquo;modern&rdquo; alternatives provided (an obvious
example is the primitive <code>&#x5c;input</code> command, whose syntax inevitably
makes life difficult for users of modern operating system file
paths).  Desirable extensions from <a href="FAQ-etex.html">e-TeX</a>,
<a href="FAQ-whatpdftex.html">PDFTeX</a> and <a href="FAQ-omegaleph.html">&Omega;</a>
have been identified.

<p>
Usability will be another focus of the work: debugging support and log
filtering mechanisms will please those who have long struggled with
TeX macros.

<p>
ExTeX will accept Unicode input, from the start.  In the longer
term, drawing primitives are to be considered.
