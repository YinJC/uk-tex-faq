<h1>Two-column float numbers out of order</h1>


<p>

<p>
When LaTeX can&rsquo;t place a float immediately, it places it on one of
several &ldquo;defer&rdquo; lists.  If another float of the same type comes
along, and the &ldquo;defer&rdquo; list for that type still has something in it,
the later float has to wait for everything earlier in the list.

<p>
Now, standard LaTeX has different lists for single-column floats,
and double-column floats; this means that single-column figures can
overtake double-column figures (or vice-versa), and you observe later
figures appear in the document before early ones.  The same is true,
of course, for tables, or for any user-defined float.

<p>
The LaTeX team recognise the problem, and provides a package
(<i class="package">fixltx2e</i>) to deal with it.  <i class="package">Fixltx2e</i> amalgamates
the two defer lists, so that floats don&rsquo;t get out of order.

<p>
For those who are still running an older LaTeX distribution, the
package <i class="package">fix2col</i> should serve.  This package (also by a
member of the LaTeX team) was the basis of the relevant part of
<i class="package">fixltx2e</i>.  The functionality has also been included in
<i class="package">dblfloatfix</i>, which also has code to place full-width floats
at <a href="FAQ-2colfloat.html"><tt>[b]</tt> placement</a>.

<p>
Once you have loaded the package, no more remains to be done: the
whole requirement is to patch the output routine; no extra commands
are needed.
