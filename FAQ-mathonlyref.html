<p>
There are those who consider that papers look untidy with numbers on
every equation; there is also a school of thought that claims that
there should be numbers everywhere, in case some reader wants to make
reference an equation to which the author made no cross-reference.

<p>
If you hold to the &ldquo;only cross-referenced&rdquo; school of thought, you
can (using the <code>&#x5c;nonumber</code> command on the relevant equations, or by
using the AMSLaTeX unnumbered environments such as
<code class="environment">equation*</code>) mark those of your equations to which you
make no reference.  In a long or complex paper, this procedure could
well become deeply tedious.

<p>
Fortunately, help is at hand: the <i class="package">mh</i> bundle&rsquo;s
<i class="package">mathtools</i> package offers a &lsquo;<code class="pkgoption">showonlyrefs</code>&rsquo;
switch through its <code>&#x5c;mathtoolsset</code> command; when that&rsquo;s in
operation, only those equations to which you make reference will be
numbered in the final output.  See the package&rsquo;s documentation for
details of how to make references when the switch is in effect.
