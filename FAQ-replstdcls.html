<h1>Replacing the standard classes</h1>


<p>

<p>
People are forever concocting classes that replace the standard ones:
the present author produced an <i class="class">ukart</i> class that used the
<i class="package">sober</i> package, and a few British-specific things (such as
appear in the <i class="package">babel</i> package&rsquo;s British-english
specialisation) in the 1980s, which is still occasionally used.

<p>
Similar public efforts were available well back in the days of
LaTeX 2.09: a notable example, whose pleasing designs seem not to have
changed much over all that time, is the <i class="class">ntgclass</i> bundle.
Each of the standard classes is replaced by a selection of classes,
named in Dutch, sometimes with a single numeric digit attached.  So we
have classes <i class="class">artikel2</i>, <i class="class">rapport1</i>, <i class="class">boek3</i> and
<i class="class">brief</i>.  These classes are moderately well documented in
English.

<p>
The <i class="class">KOMA-script</i> bundle (classes named <i class="class">scr...</i>) are a
strong current contender.  They are actively supported and are subject
to sensitive development; they are comprehensive in their coverage of
significant typesetting issues; they produce good-looking output and
they are well documented in both English (<i class="package">scrguien</i> in the
distribution) and German (<i class="package">scrguide</i> in the distribution).

<p>
The other comparable class is <i class="class">memoir</i>.  This aims to replace
<i class="class">book</i> and <i class="class">report</i> classes directly, and (like
<i class="class">KOMA-script</i>) is comprehensive in its coverage of small issues.
<i class="class">Memoir</i>&rsquo;s documentation (<i class="package">memman</i>) is very highly
spoken of, and its lengthy introductory section is regularly
recommended as a tutorial on typesetting.
