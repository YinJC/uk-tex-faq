<h1>Redefining counters&rsquo; <code>&#x5c;the-</code>commands</h1>


<p>

<p>
Whenever you request a new LaTeX counter, LaTeX creates a bunch
of behind-the-scenes commands, as well as defining the counter
itself.

<p>
Among other things, <code>&#x5c;newcounter</code><code>&#x7b;fred&#x7d;</code> creates a command
<code>&#x5c;the</code><tt><em>fred</em></tt>, which expands to &ldquo;the value of
<tt><em>fred</em></tt>&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re typesetting.

<p>
The definition of <code>&#x5c;the</code><tt><em>fred</em></tt> should express the
value of the counter: it is almost always always a mistake to use the
command to produce anything else.  The value may reasonably be
expressed as an arabic, a roman or a greek number, as an alphabetic
expression, or even as a sequence (or pattern of) symbols.  If you
need a decision process on whether to re-define
<code>&#x5c;the</code><tt><em>fred</em></tt>, consider what might happen when you do
so.

<p>
So, for example, if you want your section numbers to be terminated by
a period, you could make <code>&#x5c;thesection</code> expand with a terminating
period.  However, such a change to <code>&#x5c;thesection</code> makes the
definition of <code>&#x5c;thesubsection</code> look distinctly odd: you are going to
find yourself redefining things left, right and centre.  Rather, use
the standard techniques for 
<a href="FAQ-seccntfmt.html">adjusting the presentation of section numbers</a>. 

<p>
Or, suppose you want the page number to appear at the bottom of each
page surrounded by dashes (as in
&ldquo;<tt>-</tt>[[[LBRACE]]][[[RBRACE]]]<tt>-[[[textasciitilde]]]</tt><tt>nnn[[[textasciitilde]]]-</tt>[[[LBRACE]]][[[RBRACE]]]<tt>-</tt>&rdquo;).
If you try to achieve this by redefining <code>&#x5c;thepage</code>, problems will
arise from the use of the page number in the table of contents (each
number will have the dashes attached), and <code>&#x5c;pageref</code> references
will be oddly modified.  In this case, the change of appearance is
best done by redefining the page style itself, perhaps using
