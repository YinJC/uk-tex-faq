<h1>LaTeX won&rsquo;t include from other directories</h1>


<p>

<p>
You wanted to <code>&#x5c;include</code><code>&#x7b;../bar/xyz.tex&#x7d;</code>, but LaTeX says:
<blockquote>
<pre>
latex: Not writing to ../bar/xyz.aux (openout_any = p).
! I can't write on file `../bar/xyz.aux'.
</pre>
<pre>
LaTeX: Not writing to ../bar/xyz.aux
                          (openout_any = p).
! I can't write on file `../bar/xyz.aux'.
</pre>
</blockquote>
The error comes from TeX&rsquo;s protection against writing to
directories that aren&rsquo;t descendents of the one where your document
resides.  (The restriction protects against problems arising from
LaTeXing someone else&rsquo;s malicious, or merely broken, document.  If
such a document overwrites something you wanted kept, there is obvious
potential for havoc.)

<p>
Document directory structures that can lead to this problem will look
like the fictional <i class="filename">mybook</i>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
./base/mybook.tex
./preface/Preface.tex
./preface/***
./chapter1/Intro.tex
...
</pre>
</blockquote>
With such a structure, any document directory (other than the one
where <i class="filename">mybook.tex</i> lives), seems &ldquo;up&rdquo; the tree from the
base directory.  (References to such files will look like
<code>&#x5c;include</code><code>&#x7b;../preface/Preface&#x7d;</code>: the &ldquo;<tt>..</tt>&rdquo; is the
hint.)

<p>
But why did it want to write at all?&nbsp;&mdash; 
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-include.html">what&rsquo;s going in in my <code>&#x5c;include</code></a>&rdquo; explains
how <code>&#x5c;include</code> works, among other things by writing an
<code class="extension">aux</code> file for every <code>&#x5c;includ</code>ed file.

<p>
Solutions to the problem tend to be drastic:
<ol>
<li> Restructure the directories that hold your document so that the
  master file is at the root of the tree:
  <blockquote>
<pre>
./mybook.tex
./mybook/preface/Preface.tex
./mybook/preface/***
./mybook/chapter1/Intro.tex
...
</pre>
  </blockquote>
  and so on.
<li> Did you actually <em>need</em> <code>&#x5c;include</code>?&nbsp;&mdash; if not, you can
  replace <code>&#x5c;include</code> by <code>&#x5c;input</code> throughout.  (This only works
  if you don&rsquo;t need <code>&#x5c;includeonly</code>.)
<li> You <em>could</em> patch your system&rsquo;s <i class="filename">texmf.cnf</i>&nbsp;&mdash; if you
  know what you&rsquo;re doing, the error message should be enough of a
  hint; this action is definitely not recommended, and is left to
  those who can &ldquo;help themselves&rdquo; in this respect.
</ol>
