<h1>Setting papers for journals</h1>


<p>

<p>
Publishers of journals have a wide range of requirements for the
presentation of papers, and while many publishers do accept electronic
submissions in (La)TeX, they don&rsquo;t often submit recommended macros to
public archives.

<p>
Nevertheless, there are considerable numbers of macros of one sort or
another available on CTAN; searching for your journal name in
the CTAN catalogue&nbsp;&mdash; see 
<a href="FAQ-findfiles.html">searching CTAN</a>)&nbsp;&mdash;
may well turn up what you&rsquo;re seeking.

<p>
Failing that, you may be well advised to contact the prospective
publisher of your paper; many publishers have macros on their own web
sites, or otherwise available only upon application.

<p>
Check that the publisher is offering you macros suitable to an
environment you can use: a few still have no macros for current
LaTeX, for example, claiming that LaTeX 2.09 is good enough&hellip;

<p>
Some publishers rekey anything sent them anyway, so that it doesn&rsquo;t
really matter what macros you use.  Others merely encourage you to use
as few extensions of a standard package as possible, so that they will
find it easy to transform your paper to their own internal form.
