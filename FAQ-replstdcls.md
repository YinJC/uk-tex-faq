title: Replacing the standard classes
---

People are forever concocting classes that replace the standard ones:
the present author produced an [`ukart`](http://ctan.org/pkg/ukart) class that used the
[`sober`](http://ctan.org/pkg/sober) package, and a few British-specific things (such as
appear in the [`babel`](http://ctan.org/pkg/babel) package's British-english
specialisation) in the 1980s, which is still occasionally used.

Similar public efforts were available well back in the days of
LaTeX 2.09: a notable example, whose pleasing designs seem not to have
changed much over all that time, is the [`ntgclass`](http://ctan.org/pkg/ntgclass) bundle.
Each of the standard classes is replaced by a selection of classes,
named in Dutch, sometimes with a single numeric digit attached.  So we
have classes [`artikel2`](http://ctan.org/pkg/artikel2), [`rapport1`](http://ctan.org/pkg/rapport1), [`boek3`](http://ctan.org/pkg/boek3) and
[`brief`](http://ctan.org/pkg/brief).  These classes are moderately well documented in
English.

The [`KOMA-script`](http://ctan.org/pkg/KOMA-script) bundle (classes named [`scr...`](http://ctan.org/pkg/scr...)) are a
strong current contender.  They are actively supported and are subject
to sensitive development; they are comprehensive in their coverage of
significant typesetting issues; they produce good-looking output and
they are well documented in both English ([`scrguien`](http://ctan.org/pkg/scrguien) in the
distribution) and German ([`scrguide`](http://ctan.org/pkg/scrguide) in the distribution).

The other comparable class is [`memoir`](http://ctan.org/pkg/memoir).  This aims to replace
[`book`](http://ctan.org/pkg/book) and [`report`](http://ctan.org/pkg/report) classes directly, and (like
[`KOMA-script`](http://ctan.org/pkg/KOMA-script)) is comprehensive in its coverage of small issues.
[`Memoir`](http://ctan.org/pkg/Memoir)'s documentation ([`memman`](http://ctan.org/pkg/memman)) is very highly
spoken of, and its lengthy introductory section is regularly
recommended as a tutorial on typesetting.
