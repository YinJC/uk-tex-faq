<h1>Why use <code>&#x5c;[</code>\,&hellip;<code>&#x5c;]</code> in place of <tt>&#x24;&#x24;</tt>\,&hellip;\,<tt>&#x24;&#x24;</tt>?</h1>


<p>

<p>
LaTeX defines inline- and display-maths commands, apparently
duplicating the TeX primitive maths sequences which surround maths
commands with single (or pairs of) dollar signs.

<p>
In fact, LaTeX&rsquo;s inline maths grouping, 
<code>&#x5c;(</code><tt> ... </tt><code>&#x5c;)</code>, has (almost) exactly the same effect as the
TeX primitive version <tt>&#x24; ... &#x24;</tt>.  (The exception:
the LaTeX version checks to ensure you don&rsquo;t put <code>&#x5c;(</code> and
<code>&#x5c;)</code> the wrong way round; this does occasionally detect errors&hellip;.)

<p>
Since this is the case, one often finds LaTeX users, who have some
experience of using Plain TeX, merely assuming that LaTeX&rsquo;s
display maths grouping <code>&#x5c;[</code><tt> ... </tt><code>&#x5c;]</code> may be replaced by
the TeX primitive display maths <tt>&#x24;&#x24; ... &#x24;&#x24;</tt>.

<p>
Unfortunately, the assumption is wrong: some LaTeX code needs to
patch display maths, it can only do so by patching <code>&#x5c;[</code> and <code>&#x5c;]</code>
(or their equivalents).  Most obviously, the class option <code class="pkgoption">fleqn</code>
simply does not work for equations coded using 
<tt>&#x24;&#x24; ... &#x24;&#x24;</tt>, whether you&rsquo;re using the standard classes
alone, or using package <i class="package">amsmath</i>.  Also, the <code>&#x5c;[</code> and
<code>&#x5c;]</code> construct has code for rationalising vertical spacing in some
extreme cases; that code is not provided <tt>&#x24;&#x24; ... &#x24;&#x24;</tt>, so if
you use the Plain TeX version, you may occasionally observe
inconsistent vertical spacing.  Similar behaviour can bite if you are
writing a <em>proof</em>; placing the &ldquo;QED symbol&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work
if it is in <tt>&#x24;&#x24;</tt>-displayed maths.

<p>
There are more subtle effects (especially with package
<i class="package">amsmath</i>), and the simple rule is &ldquo;use 
<code>&#x5c;[</code><tt> ... </tt><code>&#x5c;]</code> (at least) whenever displayed maths is
needed in LaTeX&rdquo;.

<p>
(Note that the sequence <code>&#x5c;[</code><tt> ... </tt><code>&#x5c;]</code> is duplicated by
the <code class="environment">displaymath</code> environment, which can be said to &ldquo;look
nicer&rdquo;, and actually <em>describes</em> what&rsquo;s being done.)
