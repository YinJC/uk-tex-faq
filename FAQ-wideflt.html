<h1>Centring a very wide figure or table</h1>


<p>

<p>
The normal means of centring a figure or table object is to include
<code>&#x5c;centering</code> at the top of the float.  This doesn&rsquo;t help if the
object is wider than <code>&#x5c;textwidth</code>&nbsp;&mdash; the object starts at the left
margin and juts out into the right margin (which is actually doubly
unsatisfactory, since as well as looking bad, the float won&rsquo;t be
placed until the next <code>&#x5c;clearpage</code> or the like.)

<p>
You can avoid the problem by rescaling the figure or table to fit, but
this is often not satisfactory, for several reasons.

<p>
Otherwise, if the object is wider than the printable area of the page,
you&rsquo;ve no choice other than to <a href="FAQ-landscape.html">rotate it</a>.  If,
however, the object is <em>just</em> wider than the text block, you can
make it pretend to be the right size by:
<blockquote>

<pre>
\begin{figure}
  \noindent
  \makebox[\textwidth]{\includegraphics{my-wide-figure}}%
  \caption{This figure juts out into both margins}
\end{figure}
</pre>


<pre>
\begin{figure}
  \noindent
  \makebox[\textwidth]{%
    \includegraphics{my-wide-figure}%
  }%
  \caption{This figure juts out into both margins}
\end{figure}
</pre>

</blockquote>
Note the <code>&#x5c;noindent</code>: the <code>&#x5c;makebox</code> starts a paragraph, and you
really don&rsquo;t want that indented by <code>&#x5c;parindent</code>.
