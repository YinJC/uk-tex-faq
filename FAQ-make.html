<p>

<p>
LaTeX documents are tricky beasts for building using
(<i class="progname">Uni*x</i>) <i class="progname">make</i> on: the need to
instruct LaTeX to run several times for essentially different
reasons (for example, &ldquo;get the table of contents stable&rdquo;, &ldquo;get the
labels stable&rdquo;, &ldquo;add the bibliography&rdquo;, &ldquo;add the index&rdquo;) is
actually rather difficult to express in the &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; sort of
dependency graph that one constructs for <i class="progname">make</i>.

<p>
The <i class="progname">latex-make</i> package offers help with this task (far more
sophisticated techniques than in the script that builds these FAQs); it
looks good, but reports of its use (other than by its author) are scarce.

<p>
For a long time, the only <i class="progname">make</i>-like package on CTAN
was <i class="progname">latexmk</i>, which is a <i class="progname">Perl</i>
script that analyses your LaTeX source for its dependencies, runs
BibTeX or <i class="progname">makeindex</i> as and when it notices that those
programs&rsquo; input (parts of the <code class="extension">aux</code> file, or the
<code class="extension">idx</code> file, respectively) has changed, and so on.
<i class="progname">Latexmk</i> is a fine 
solution (and was used in generating printable versions of these
FAQs for some time); it has recently been upgraded and has
many bells and whistles that allow it to operate as if it were a poor
man&rsquo;s WYSIWYG system.

<p>
A recent strong contender is <i class="progname">arara</i>, written in
<i class="progname">Java</i>.  It is (the documentation says) based on &ldquo;rules&rdquo;
and &ldquo;directives&rdquo;; its aim is to determine what to do from explicit
instructions in the document&rsquo;s source code, rather than secondary
sources such as log file analysis.  <i class="progname">Arara</i> is relatively new
on CTAN, and comes with recommendations from many of the great and
good of the LaTeX world.

<p>
Newer still is the Python script <i class="progname">try</i>, which has a similar
structure to <i class="progname">arara</i>&nbsp;&mdash; it, too, reads instructions in the
document source.

<p>
Apparently along the same lines, is AutoLaTeX.  The <i class="filename">README</i>
of the distribution is actual a Unix-type man-page output, and shows
great attention to the details of the document production process.

<p>
The (Ruby) script <i class="progname">mk</i> (also, apparently, known as
<i class="progname">latex_maker</i>) works well with another of the author&rsquo;s
scripts script called <i class="progname">vpp</i> (View and Print
PostScript/PDF).

<p>
Windows users of the MiKTeX system may use that system&rsquo;s
<i class="progname">texify</i> application.  <i class="progname">Texify</i> deals with basic
LaTeX features, including generating a bibliography and an index;
it makes no claim to deal with other things (such as multiple
bibliographies or indexes, or lists of terminology, etc.), which
AutoLaTeX can be configured to process.

<p>
The <a href="FAQ-texinfo.html"><i class="package">texinfo</i> system</a> comes with a similar
utility called <i class="progname">texi2dvi</i>, which is capable of &ldquo;converting&rdquo;
either LaTeX or <i class="package">texinfo</i> files into DVI (or into
PDF, using PDFTeX).

<p>
A later contribution is the bundle <i class="package">latexmake</i>, which
offers a set of <i class="progname">make</i> rules that invoke <i class="progname">texi2dvi</i>
as necessary.

<p>
The curious may examine the rules employed to run the present
FAQ through LaTeX: we don&rsquo;t present them as a complete
solution, but some of the tricks employed are surely re-usable.
