<p>

<p>
In the very earliest days of LaTeX 2e, the only way to use the
T1 encoding was <i class="package">t1enc</i>; with the summer 1994
&ldquo;production&rdquo; release, the <i class="package">fontenc</i> package appeared, and
provided comprehensive support for use of the encoding.

<p>
Nevertheless, the <i class="package">t1enc</i> package remains (as part of the
LaTeX 2.09 compatibility code), but it does very little: it merely
selects font encoding T1, and leaves to the user the business
of generating the character codes required.

<p>
Generating such character codes could be a simple matter, <em>if</em>
the T1 encoding matched any widely-supported encoding standard,
since in that case, one might expect one&rsquo;s keyboard to generate the
character codes.  However, the T1 encoding is a mix of several
standard encodings, and includes code points in areas of the table
which standard encodings specifically exclude, so no T1
keyboards have been (or ever will be) manufactured.

<p>
By contrast, the <i class="package">fontenc</i> package generates the T1
code points from ordinary LaTeX commands (e.g., it generates the
<tt>&eacute;</tt> character codepoint from the command <code>&#x5c;&rsquo;</code><tt>e</tt>).
So, unless you have program-generated T1 input (which is almost
inconceivable), use <code>&#x5c;usepackage</code><code>[T1]</code></code><code>&#x7b;fontenc&#x7d;</code> rather than
<code>&#x5c;usepackage</code><code>&#x7b;t1enc&#x7d;</code>.
