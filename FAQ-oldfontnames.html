<h1>Old LaTeX font references such as <code>&#x5c;tenrm</code></h1>


<p>

<p>
LaTeX 2.09 defined a large set of commands for access to the fonts
that it had built in to itself.  For example, <i class="fontname">cmr</i> might
appear as <code>&#x5c;fivrm</code>, <code>&#x5c;sixrm</code>, <code>&#x5c;sevrm</code>,
<code>&#x5c;egtrm</code>, <code>&#x5c;ninrm</code>, <code>&#x5c;tenrm</code>, <code>&#x5c;elvrm</code>, <code>&#x5c;twlrm</code>,
<code>&#x5c;frtnrm</code>, <code>&#x5c;svtnrm</code>, <code>&#x5c;twtyrm</code> and <code>&#x5c;twfvrm</code>, according
to the size it&rsquo;s being typeset at.
These commands were never documented, but certain packages
nevertheless used them to achieve effects they needed.

<p>
Since the commands weren&rsquo;t public, they weren&rsquo;t included in LaTeX 2e;
to use the unconverted LaTeX 2.09 packages under LaTeX 2e, you need
also to include the <i class="package">rawfonts</i> package (which is part of the
LaTeX 2e distribution).
