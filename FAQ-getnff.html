<h1>Getting &lsquo;free&rsquo; fonts not in your distribution</h1>


<p>

<p>
Some fonts are free to use, but may not be sold.  This creates a
dilemma for distributions: users may want the fonts, but since the
distribution is also available on a DVD for sale, the fonts may
not be in the distribtution.

<p>
The CTAN archives hold such fonts, together with all the
necessary support files, but even with the support files ready-made,
installing a font is a tedious business.

<p>
For texlive users, this dilemma is solved by the
<i class="progname">getnonfreefonts</i> script.  Download the script installer from
<a href="http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/.html">http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/</a>; the web page tells you
how to run the installer to get the script, and what fonts are
currently available

<p>
Once the script is installed, you can ask it what it has available by
saying:
<blockquote>
<pre>
getnonfreefonts -l
</pre>
</blockquote>
and you can ask it to install a font (in your local texmf tree) by:
<blockquote>
<pre>
getnonfreefonts luximono
</pre>
</blockquote>
(for example; the printed version of the FAQ uses luximono, so
that the example was to hand&hellip;).

<p>
(System adminstrators may use <i class="progname">getnonfreefonts-sys</i>, which
will install the font in the &lsquo;public&rsquo; <tt>texmf</tt> tree, so that all
users of the system may use the new font.)

<p>
The script will download the relevant font files from CTAN,
extract them from their <code class="extension">zip</code> file, install them and update
the font maps.  It even goes so far as to apologise for how long it&rsquo;s
taking!
