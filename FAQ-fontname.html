<h1>What is the &ldquo;Berry naming scheme&rdquo;?</h1>


<p>

<p>
In the olden days, (La)TeX distributions were limited by the
feebleness of file systems&rsquo; ability to represent long names.  (The
MSDOS file system was a particular bugbear: fortunately any current
Microsoft system allows rather more freedom to specify file names.
Sadly, the ISO&nbsp;9660 standard for the structure of CD-ROMs has a
similar failing, but that too has been modified by various extension
mechanisms.)

<p>
One area in which these short file names posed a particular problem
was that of file names for Type&nbsp;1 fonts.
These fonts are distributed by their vendors with
pretty meaningless short names, and there&rsquo;s a natural ambition to
change the name to something that identifies the font somewhat
precisely.  Unfortunately, names such as &ldquo;BaskervilleMT&rdquo; are
already far beyond the abilities of the typical feeble file system,
and add the specifier of a font shape or variant, and the difficulties
spiral out of control.  Font companies deal with the issue by
inventing silly names, and providing a map file to show what the
&ldquo;real&rdquo; names.  Thus the Monotype Corporation provides the
translations:
<blockquote>
  <tt>bas\_\_\_\_\_ BaskervilleMT</tt><br>
  <tt>basb\_\_\_\_ BaskervilleMT-Bold</tt><br>
  <tt>basbi\_\_\_ BaskervilleMT-BoldItalic</tt>
</blockquote>
and so on.  These names could be used within (La)TeX programs,
except that they are not unique: there&rsquo;s nothing to stop Adobe using
&lsquo;<tt>bas\_\_\_\_\_</tt>&rsquo; for <em>their</em> Baskerville font.

<p>
Thus arose the Berry naming scheme.

<p>
The basis of the scheme is to encode the meanings of the various parts
of the file&rsquo;s specification in an extremely terse way, so that enough
font names can be expressed even in impoverished file name-spaces.  The
encoding allocates one character to the font &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; (Adobe, Monotype,
and so on), two to the typeface name (Baskerville, Times Roman, and so
on), one to the weight, shape, and encoding and so on.  

<p>
The whole scheme is outlined in the <i class="package">fontname</i> distribution,
which includes extensive documentation and a set of tables of fonts
whose names have been systematised.
