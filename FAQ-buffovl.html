<p>

<p>
TeX belongs to the generation of applications written for
environments that didn&rsquo;t offer the sophisticated string and i/o
manipulation we nowadays take for granted (TeX was written in
Pascal, and the original Pascal standard made no mention of i/o, so
that anything but the most trivial operations were likely to be
unportable).

<p>
When you overwhelm TeX&rsquo;s input mechanism, you get told:
<pre>
! Unable to read an entire line---bufsize=3000.
    Please ask a wizard to enlarge me.
</pre>
(for some value of &lsquo;3000&rsquo;&nbsp;&mdash; the quote was from a
<i class="newsgroup">comp.text.tex</i> posting by a someone who was presumably
using an old TeX).

<p>
As the message implies, there&rsquo;s (what TeX thinks of as a) line in
your input that&rsquo;s &ldquo;too long&rdquo; (to TeX&rsquo;s way of thinking).  Since
modern distributions tend to have tens of thousands of bytes of input
buffer, it&rsquo;s somewhat rare that these messages occur &ldquo;for real&rdquo;.
Probable culprits are:
<ul>
<li> A file transferred from another system, without translating
  record endings.  With the decline of fixed-format records (on
  mainframe operating systems) and the increased intelligence of
  TeX distributions at recognising other systems&rsquo; explicit
  record-ending characters, this is nowadays rather a rare cause of
  the problem.
<li> A graphics input file, which a package is examining for its
  bounding box, contains a binary preview section.  Again,
  sufficiently clever TeX distributions recognise this situation,
  and ignore the previews (which are only of interest, if at all, to a
  TeX previewer).
</ul>

<p>
The usual advice is to ignore what TeX says (i.e., anything about
enlarging), and to put the problem right in the source. 

<p>
If the real problem is over-long text lines, most self-respecting text
editors will be pleased to automatically split long lines (while
preserving the &ldquo;word&rdquo; structure) so that they are nowhere any longer
than a given length; so the solution is just to edit the file.

<p>
If the problem is a ridiculous preview section, try using
<a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/"><i class="progname">ghostscript</i></a>
to reprocess the file, outputting a &ldquo;plain
<code class="extension">eps</code>&rdquo; file.  (<i class="progname">Ghostscript</i>&rsquo;s distribution
includes a script <i class="progname">ps2epsi</i> which will regenerate the preview
if necessary.)  Users of the shareware program 
<a href="http://www.ghostgum.com.au/"><i class="progname">gsview</i></a>
will find buttons to perform the required transformation of the file
being displayed.
