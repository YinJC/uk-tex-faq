<h1>(Modern) Windows systems</h1>


<p>

<p>
Windows users nowadays have a real choice, between two excellent
distributions, MiKTeX and texlive.  texlive on windows has
only in recent years been a real challenger to the long-established
MiKTeX, and even now MiKTeX has features that texlive lacks.
Both are comprehensive
distributions, offering all the established TeX variants (TeX,
PDFTeX&nbsp;&mdash; both with e-TeX variants&nbsp;&mdash; as well as XeTeX and
LuaTeX), together with a wide range of support tools.

<p>
Both MiKTeX and texlive offer management tools, including the
means of keeping an installation &ldquo;up-to-date&rdquo;, by reinstalling
packages that have been updated on CTAN (the delay between a
package update appearing, and it being available to the distribution
users) can be as short as a day (and is never very long).

<p>
MiKTeX, by Christian Schenk, is the longer-established of the pair,
and has a large audience of satisfied users; texlive is the
dominant distribution in use in the world of Unix-like systems, and so
its Windows version may be expected to appeal to those who use both
Unix-like and Windows systems.  The latest release of MiKTeX&nbsp;&mdash;
version 2.9&nbsp;&mdash; requires Windows&nbsp;XP, or later (so it does not work on
Windows&nbsp;2000 or earlier).

<p>
Both distributions may be used in a configuration which involves no
installation at all.  MiKTeX&rsquo;s &ldquo;portable&rdquo; distribution may be
unpacked on a memory stick, and used on any windows computer without
making any direct use of the hard drive.  The web page 
<a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/portable.html">texlive portable usage</a>
describes the options for installing texlive on a memory stick, or
for using the texlive DVD with no installation at all.

<p>
Both MiKTeX and texlive may be downloaded and installed, package
by package, over the net.  This is a mammoth undertaking, only to be
undertaken by those with a good network connection (and a patient
disposition!).

<p>
A ready-to-run copy of the MiKTeX distribution,
on DVD may be bought via the 
<a href="http://www.miktex.org/cd/">MiKTeX web site</a>.  MiKTeX may
also be installed using ProTeXt, on the 
<a href="FAQ-CD.html">TeX Collection DVD</a>.

<p>
The <a href="FAQ-CD.html">TeX Collection DVD</a> also provides an
offline installer for texlive.

<p>
























<p>
A further (free) option is available thanks to the
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">CygWin bundle</a>, which presents a
Unix-like environment in Windows systems (and also provides an
X-windows server).  The (now obsolete) teTeX distribution is
provided as part of the CygWin distribution, but there is a CygWin
build of texlive so you can have a current TeX system.  TeX
under CygWin is reputedly somewhat slower than native Win32
implementations such as MiKTeX, and of course the TeX
applications behave like Unix-system applications.

<p>
BaKoMa TeX, by Basil Malyshev, is a comprehensive (shareware)
distribution, which focuses on support of Acrobat.  The distribution
comes with a bunch of Type&nbsp;1 fonts packaged to work with BaKoMa
TeX, which further the focus.
