The AMS publishes a &ldquo;Short Math Guide for LaTeX&rdquo;, which is
available (in several formats) via
<a href="http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html.html">http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html</a> (the &ldquo;Additional
Documentation&rdquo; about half-way down the page.

<p>
Herbert Vo&szlig; has written an extensive guide to mathematics in
LaTeX, and a development of it has been 
<a href="FAQ-latex-books.html">published as a book</a>.

<p>
Two documents written more than ten years apart about font usage in
TeX are worth reading: 
<a href="http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb14-2/tb39rahtz-nfss.pdf.html">Essential NFSS</a>
by Sebastian Rahtz, and 
<a href="http://tug.org/pracjourn/2006-1/schmidt/schmidt.pdf.html">Font selection in LaTeX</a>,
cast in the form of an FAQ, by Walter Schmidt.  A general
compendium of font information (including the two above) may be found
on the <a href="http://www.tug.org/fonts/.html">TUG web site</a>.

<p>
TUG India is developing a series of online LaTeX tutorials
which can be strongly recommended: select single chapters at a time
from <a href="http://www.tug.org/tutorials/tugindia.html">http://www.tug.org/tutorials/tugindia</a>&nbsp;&mdash; there
are 17&nbsp;chapters in the series, two of which are mostly introductory.

<p>
Peter Smith&rsquo;s





  
  &ldquo;<a href="http://www.logicmatters.net/latex-for-logicians/.html">LaTeX for Logicians</a>&rdquo;

page covers a rather smaller subject area, but is similarly comprehensive
(mostly by links to documents on relevant topics, rather than as a
monolithic document).

<p>
Keith Reckdahl&rsquo;s &ldquo;Using Imported Graphics in LaTeX 2e&rdquo;
(<i class="package">epslatex</i>) is an
excellent introduction to graphics use.  It&rsquo;s available on
CTAN, but not in the texlive or miktex[[[LBRACE]]][[[RBRACE]]] distributions, for
lack of sources.

<p>
Stefan Kottwitz manages a web site devoted to the use of the drawing
packages 
<a href="FAQ-drawing.html">PGF and TikZ</a>, 
<a href="http://www.texample.net/.html">http://www.texample.net/</a>

<p>
Included is 
 <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/.html">examples catalogue</a>
includes examples (with output) from the package documentation as well
as code written by the original site maintainer (Kjell Magne Fauske)
and others.

<p>
The compendious PGF/TikZ manual is clear, but is
bewildering for some beginners.  The 
<a href="http://cremeronline.com/LaTeX/minimaltikz.pdf.html">&lsquo;minimal&rsquo; introduction</a>
has helped at least the present author.

<p>
Vincent Zoonekynd provides a set of excellent (and graphic) tutorials
on the programming of 
<a href="http://zoonek.free.fr/LaTeX/LaTeX_samples_title/0.html.html">title page styles</a>,
<a href="http://zoonek.free.fr/LaTeX/LaTeX_samples_chapter/0.html.html">chapter heading styles</a>
and
<a href="http://zoonek.free.fr/LaTeX/LaTeX_samples_section/0.html.html">section heading styles</a>.
In each file, there is a selection of graphics representing an output
style, and for each style, the code that produces it is shown.

<p>
An invaluable step-by-step setup guide for establishing a &ldquo;work
flow&rdquo; through your (La)TeX system, so that output appears at the
correct size and position on standard-sized paper, and that the print
quality is satisfactory, is Mike Shell&rsquo;s <i class="package">testflow</i>.  The
tutorial consists of a large plain text document, and there is a
supporting LaTeX file together with correct output, both in PostScript and
PDF, for each of A4 and &ldquo;letter&rdquo; paper sizes.  The
complete kit is available on CTAN (distributed with the
author&rsquo;s macros for papers submitted for IEEE publications).
The issues are also covered in a later 
<a href="FAQ-dvips-pdf.html">FAQ answer</a>.

<p>
Documentation of Japanese Omega use appears in
Haruhiko Okumura&rsquo;s page

<a href="http://oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp/&nbsp;okumura/texfaq/japanese/.html">typesetting Japanese with Omega</a>
(the parent page is in Japanese, so out of the scope of this
FAQ list).

<p>
Some university departments make their local documentation available
on the web.  Most straightforwardly, there&rsquo;s the simple translation of
existing documentation into HTML, for example the INFO
documentation of the (La)TeX installation, of which a sample is the
LaTeX documentation available at
<a href="http://www.tac.dk/cgi-bin/info2www?(latex).html">http://www.tac.dk/cgi-bin/info2www?(latex)</a>

<p>
More ambitiously, some university departments have enthusiastic
documenters who 
make public record of their (La)TeX support.  For example, Tim Love
(of Cambridge University Engineering Department) maintains his
department&rsquo;s pages at
<a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/.html">http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/</a>
