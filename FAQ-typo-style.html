<p>

<p>
Peter Wilson&rsquo;s article <i class="package">memdesign</i> has a lengthy introductory
section on typographic considerations, which is a fine tutorial,
written by someone who is aware of the issues as they apply to
(La)TeX users.  (<i class="package">Memdesign</i> now distributed separately from
the manual for his <i class="class">memoir</i> class, but was originally part of
that manual)

<p>
There&rsquo;s also (at least one) typographic style tutorial available on
the Web, the excellent 
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/~hedrick/typography/typography.janson-syntax.107514.pdf">Guidelines for Typography in NBCS</a>&rdquo;.
In fact, its 
<a href="http://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/~hedrick/typography/index.html">parent page</a>
is also worth a read: among other things, it provides copies of the
&ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; document in a wide variety of primary fonts, for
comparison purposes.  The author is careful to explain that he has no
ambition to supplant such excellent books as
<a href="FAQ-type-books.html">Bringhurst&rsquo;s</a>, but the document (though it does
contain its Rutgers-local matter) is a fine introduction to the issues
of producing readable documents.
