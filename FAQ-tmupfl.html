<h1>&ldquo;Too many unprocessed floats&rdquo;</h1>


<p>

<p>
If LaTeX responds to a <code>&#x5c;begin</code><code>&#x7b;figure&#x7d;</code> or
<code>&#x5c;begin</code><code>&#x7b;table&#x7d;</code> command with the error message
<blockquote>
<pre>
! LaTeX Error: Too many unprocessed floats.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
</pre>
</blockquote>
your figures (or tables) are not being placed properly.  LaTeX
has a limited amount of storage for &lsquo;floats&rsquo; (figures, tables, or
floats you&rsquo;ve defined yourself with the <i class="package">float</i> package); if
something you have done has prevented LaTeX from typesetting
floats, it will run out of storage space.

<p>
This failure usually occurs in extreme cases of 
<a href="FAQ-floats.html">floats moving &ldquo;wrongly&rdquo;</a>;
LaTeX has found it can&rsquo;t place a float, and floats of the same type
have piled up behind it.

<p>
How does this happen?&nbsp;&mdash; LaTeX guarantees that caption numbers are
sequential in the document, but the caption number is allocated when
the figure (or whatever) is created, and can&rsquo;t be changed.  Thus, if
floats are placed out of order, their caption numbers would also
appear out of order in the body of the document (and in the list of
figures, or whatever).  As a result, enforcement of the guarantee
means that simple failure to place a float means that no subsequent
float can be placed; and hence (eventually) the error.

<p>
Techniques for solving the problem are discussed in the 
<a href="FAQ-floats.html">floats question</a> already referenced.

<p>
An alternative <em>may</em> be to use the <i class="package">morefloats</i> package.
The package will allocate more &ldquo;float skeletons&rdquo; than LaTeX
does by default; each such skeleton may then be used to store a
float.  Beware that even with <i class="package">morefloats</i>, the number you can
allocate is limited; even with the <i class="package">etex</i> package (which makes
available many more registers, etc., than LaTeX does by default;
e-TeX can create lots more registers, but none of those &ldquo;beyond
the original TeX default&rdquo; may be used in float skeletons).  Thus,
<i class="package">etex</i> may offer some relief, but it can <em>not</em> be
regarded as a panacea

<p>
The error also occurs in a long sequence of float environments, with
no intervening text.  Unless the environments will fit &ldquo;here&rdquo; (and
you&rsquo;ve allowed them to go &ldquo;here&rdquo;), there will never be a page break,
and so there will never be an opportunity for LaTeX to reconsider
placement.  (Of course, the floats can&rsquo;t all fit &ldquo;here&rdquo; if the
sequence is sufficiently prolonged: once the page fills, LaTeX
won&rsquo;t place any more floats, leading to the error.

<p>
Techniques for resolution may involve redefining the floats using the
<i class="package">float</i> package&rsquo;s <tt>[H]</tt> float qualifier, but you are unlikely
to get away without using <code>&#x5c;clearpage</code> from time to time.
