<h1>Creating a bibliography style</h1>


<p>

<p>
It <em>is</em> possible to write your own: the standard bibliography
styles are distributed in a form with many comments, and there is a description
of the language in the BibTeX distribution (see 
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-BibTeXing.html">BibTeX documentation</a>).
However, it must be admitted that the language in which BibTeX
styles are written is pretty obscure, and one would not recommend
anyone who&rsquo;s not a confident programmer to write their own, though
minor changes to an existing style may be within the grasp of many.

<p>
If your style isn&rsquo;t too &lsquo;far out&rsquo;, you can probably avoid programming
it by using the facilities of the <i class="package">custom-bib</i> bundle.  The bundle
contains a file <i class="filename">makebst.tex</i>, which runs you through a text menu
to produce a file of instructions, which you can then use to generate your
own <code class="extension">bst</code> file.  This technique doesn&rsquo;t offer entirely new styles
of document, but the <i class="package">custom-bib</i>&rsquo;s &ldquo;master BibTeX
styles&rdquo; already offer significantly more than the BibTeX standard set.

<p>
An alternative, which is increasingly often recommended, to use
<a href="FAQ-biblatex.html"><i class="package">biblatex</i></a>.  <i class="package">Biblatex</i> offers
many hooks for adjusting the format of the output of your &lsquo;basic&rsquo;
BibTeX style, and a collection of &lsquo;contributed&rsquo; styles have also
started to appear.  Note.bowever There are not as many of
<i class="package">biblatex</i>&rsquo;s contributed styles as there are for BibTeX,
and there is no <i class="package">custom-biblatex</i>, both of which suggest that
beginners&rsquo; r\"ole models are hard to come by.  As a result, beginners
should probably resist the temptation to write their own contributed
<i class="package">biblatex</i> style.
