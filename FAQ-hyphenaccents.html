<p>
TeX&rsquo;s algorithm for hyphenation gives up when it encounters an
<code>&#x5c;accent</code> command; there are good reasons for this, but it means
that quality typesetting in non-English languages can be difficult.

<p>
For TeX macro packages, you can avoiding the effect by using an
appropriately encoded font (for example, a Cork-encoded font&nbsp;&mdash; see
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-ECfonts.html">the EC fonts</a>) which contains accented
letters as single glyphs.  LaTeX users can achieve this end simply
by adding the command
<pre>
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
</pre>
to the preamble of their document.  Other encodings (notably
LY1, once promoted by Y&amp;Y inc) may be used
in place of T1.  Indeed, most current 8-bit TeX font
encodings will &lsquo;work&rsquo; with the relevant sets of hyphenation patterns. 

<p>
With the advance of XeTeX and LuaTeX to the mainstream, a new
regime for generating hyphenation tables is in place.  For each
language, a table is written in Unicode, and &ldquo;8-bit&rdquo; versions are
generated for use with various LaTeX font encodings.  Original sets
of patterns remain on CTAN, for use when an older environment
is needed.
