# Online introductions: LaTeX




A pleasing little document, ''Getting something out of LaTeX'' is
designed to give a feel of LaTeX to someone who's never used it at
all.  It's not a tutorial, merely helps the user to decide whether to
go on to a tutorial, and thence to 'real' use of LaTeX.


Tobias Oetiker's '(Not so) Short Introduction to LaTeX 2e', is
regularly updated, as people suggest better ways of explaining things,
etc.  The introduction is available on CTAN, together with
translations into a rather large set of languages.


Peter Flynn's ''Beginner's LaTeX'' (which started life as course
material) is a pleasing read.  A complete copy may be found on
CTAN, but it may also be browsed over the web
([http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/beginlatex/html/]).


Harvey Greenberg's 'Simplified Introduction to LaTeX' was written
for a lecture course, and is also available on CTAN (in PostScript
only, unfortunately).


The fourth edition of George Gr&auml;tzer's book ''Math into LaTeX''
contains a ''short course'' in LaTeX itself, and that course has
been made publicly available on CTAN.


Philip Hirschhorn's ''Getting up and running with AMSLaTeX'' has a
brief introduction to LaTeX itself, followed by a substantial
introduction to the use of the AMS classes and the
[`amsmath`](http://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath) package and other things that are potentially of
interest to those writing documents containing mathematics.


Edith Hodgen's 
[LaTeX, a Braindump](http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/&nbsp;david/latex/notes.pdf)
starts you from the ground up&nbsp;&mdash; giving a basic tutorial in the use
of `Linux` to get you going (rather a large file&hellip;).
Its parent site, David Friggens' 
[documentation page](http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/&nbsp;david/latex/) is a
useful collection of links in itself.


[Andy Roberts' introductory material](http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/)
is a pleasing short introduction to the use of (La)TeX; some of the
slides for _actual_ tutorials are to be found on the page, as
well.


D. R.&nbsp;Wilkins' 
['Getting started with LaTeX'](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/&nbsp;dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/)
also looks good (it appears shorter&nbsp;&mdash; more of a primer&nbsp;&mdash; than some
of the other offerings).


Chris Harrison's 
[LaTeX tutorial](http://xoph.co/20111024/latex-tutorial/)
presents basic LaTeX in a rather pleasing and straightforward way.


Nicola Talbot's 
[LaTeX for complete novices](http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/novices/)
does what it claims: the author teaches LaTeX at the University of
East Anglia.  The ''Novices'' tutorial is one of several 
[introductory tutorials](http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/),
which include exercises (with solutions).  Other tutorials include
those for 
[writing theses/dissertations with LaTeX](http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/thesis/), and for 
[using LaTeX in administrative work](http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/admin/)


Engelbert Buxbaum provides the 'slides' for his LaTeX course 'The
LaTeX document preparation system'; this seems to be a departmental
course at his university.


Mark van Dongen's 
['LaTeX and friends']("http://csweb.ucc.ie/&nbsp;dongen/LaTeX-and-Friends.pdf)
appeared as he was writing his book on the subject (soon to be published).


An interesting (and practical) tutorial about what _not_ to do is
[`l2tabu`](http://ctan.org/pkg/l2tabu), or ''A list of sins of LaTeX 2e users'' by Mark
Trettin, translated into English by J&uuml;rgen Fenn.  The
tutorial is available from CTAN as a PDF file (though
the source is also available).
  (in English, you may browse for sources and other language versions at
