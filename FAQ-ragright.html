<h1>Setting text ragged right</h1>


<p>

<p>
The trick with typesetting ragged right is to be sure you&rsquo;ve told the
TeX engine &ldquo;make this paragraph ragged, but never <em>too</em>
ragged&rdquo;.  The LaTeX <code>&#x5c;raggedright</code> command (and the
corresponding <code class="environment">flushleft</code> environment) has a tendency to
miss the &ldquo;never&rdquo; part, and will often create ridiculously short
lines, for some minor benefit later in the paragraph.  The
Plain TeX version of the command doesn&rsquo;t suffer this failing, but
is rather conservative: it is loath to create too large a gap at the
end of the line, but in some circumstances&nbsp;&mdash; such as where
<a href="FAQ-hyphoff.html">hyphenation is suppressed</a>&nbsp;&mdash; painfully large gaps
may sometimes be required.

<p>
Martin Schr\"oder&rsquo;s <i class="package">ragged2e</i> package offers the best of both
worlds: it provides raggedness which is built on the Plain TeX
model, but which is easily configurable.  It defines easily-remembered
command (e.g., <code>&#x5c;RaggedRight</code>) and environment (e.g.,
<code class="environment">FlushLeft</code>) names that are simply capitalised
transformations of the LaTeX kernel originals.  The documentation
discusses the issues and explains the significance of the various
parameters of <i class="package">ragged2e</i>&rsquo;s operation.
