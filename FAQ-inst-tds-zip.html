<p>

<p>
Installing packages, as they (&ldquo;traditionally&rdquo;) appear on
CTAN, involves:
<ul>
<li> identifying where to put the various files on an TDS
  tree,
<li> installing them, and
<li> a few housekeeping operations.
</ul>
Most people, for most packages, find the first two steps onerous, the
last being easy (unless it is forgotten!).

<p>
Ready-built ZIP files&nbsp;&mdash; also known as 
<a href="FAQ-tds-zip.html">TDS-ZIP files</a>&nbsp;&mdash; are designed to lighten
the load of performing the first two steps of installation: they
contain all the files that are to be installed for a given
package, in their &ldquo;correct&rdquo; locations in a 
<a href="FAQ-tds.html">TDS tree</a>.

<p>
To install such a file on a Unix system (we assume that you&rsquo;ll install
into the local TEXMF tree, at <tt>&#x24;TEXMFLOCAL</tt>):
<blockquote>
<pre>
cd $TEXMFLOCAL
unzip $package.tds.zip
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
On a Windows system that is modern enough that it has a built-in
ZIP unpacker, simply double-click on the file, and browse to
where it&rsquo;s to be unpacked.  (We trust that those using earlier
versions of Windows will already have experience of using
<i class="progname">WinZIP</i> or the like.)

<p>
Having unpacked the <code class="extension">zip</code> archive, in most cases the only
remaining chore is to update the file indexes&nbsp;&mdash; as in 
<a href="FAQ-inst-wlcf.html">normal installation instructions</a>.  However, if
the package provides a font, you also need to enable the font&rsquo;s map,
which is discussed in 
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-instt1font.html">Installing a Type&nbsp;1 font</a>&rdquo;
