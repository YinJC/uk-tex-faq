<h1>XeTeX</h1>

<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/xetex.html">XeTeX</a>, by Jonathan Kew, is a
successor to the shareware TeX/GX program for Macintoshes.  It was
developed as a WEB &lsquo;change file&rsquo; applied to the original source
of TeX; the main changes include:
<dl>
<dt class="description">The input stage</dt><dd> XeTeX by default reads Unicode (UTF-8, for
  instance), although it&rsquo;s also capable of interpreting differently
  encoded files (for backwards compatibility).  Multibyte characters
  are reduced to a single internal character upon reading, so they are
  considered as a unique entity when tokenization is performed.  (So,
  for example, you can have command names in cyrillic, if you must,
  but such a practice is not recommended.)
<dt class="description">The font management</dt><dd> a substantial revision has added support
  for OpenType and TrueType fonts, delegating some parts to
  third-party libraries.
<dt class="description">The maths font set up</dt><dd> XeTeX introduces new primitives for
  extending the <code>&#x5c;mathcode</code> and <code>&#x5c;mathchardef</code> commands in TeX,
  allowing the user to specify characters in the whole Unicode set and
  in 256 &lsquo;math families&rsquo; (TeX only has 16, which limits some maths
  coding techniques).
<dt class="description">&ldquo;Post-processing&rdquo; features (A)</dt><dd> XeTeX links to the
  <i class="progname">teckit</i> library so it can apply a <code class="extension">map</code> file
  that allows transformation of characters in already formed token
  lists, before they are processed in the &ldquo;stomach&rdquo; for typesetting.
  In this way, a declaration &ldquo;<tt>Ligatures=TeX</tt>&rdquo; is provided,
  which attaches a map directive to the font that transforms the
  character combinations (familiar to TeX users) into a single
  character; for instance <tt>-[[[LBRACE]]][[[RBRACE]]]-[[[LBRACE]]][[[RBRACE]]]-</tt> is transformed into
  &ldquo;&mdash;&rdquo;.
<dt class="description">&ldquo;Post-processing&rdquo; features (B)</dt><dd> Characters can be assigned to
  an &ldquo;interchar token class&rdquo; and it is possible to specify tokens to
  be added when there is a transition from one class to another.  The
  packages <i class="package">polyglossia</i>, <i class="package">xeCJK</i> and
  <i class="package">ucharclasses</i> exploit this feature.
</dl>
Otherwise, the process of typesetting is essentially the same as
TeX&rsquo;s.  (However some changes have also been made in the
hyphenation stage that may give slightly different results if the same
document is compiled with PDFTeX or XeTeX.)
