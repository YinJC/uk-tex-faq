<h1>How to do bold-tt or bold-sc</h1>


<p>

<p>
LaTeX, as delivered, offers no means of handling bold &ldquo;teletype&rdquo;
or small-caps fonts.  There&rsquo;s a practical reason for this (Knuth never
designed such fonts), but there are typographical considerations too
(the &ldquo;medium weight&rdquo; <tt>cmtt</tt> font is already pretty bold (by
comparison with other fixed-width fonts), and bold small-caps is not
popular with many professional typographers).

<p>
There&rsquo;s a set of &ldquo;extra&rdquo; MetaFont files on CTAN that provide bold
versions of both <tt>cmtt</tt> and <tt>cmcsc</tt> (the small caps font).  With
modern TeX distributions, one may bring these fonts into use simply
by placing them in an 
<a href="FAQ-install-where.html">appropriate place in the <em>texmf</em> tree</a>
(these are (La)TeX-specific files, so the &ldquo;<em>public</em>&rdquo; supplier
would be an appropriate place).  Once you&rsquo;ve 
<a href="FAQ-inst-wlcf.html">rebuilt the file indexes as necessary</a>,
TeX (and friends) will automatically build whatever font files they
need when you first make reference to them.  There&rsquo;s a jiffy package
<i class="package">bold-extra</i> that builds the necessary font data structures
so that you can use the fonts within LaTeX.

<p>
Another alternative is to use the <a href="FAQ-ECfonts.html">EC fonts</a>,
which come with bold variants of the small-caps fonts.

<p>
If you need to use Type&nbsp;1 fonts, you can&rsquo;t proceed with Knuth-style
fonts, since there are no Type&nbsp;1 versions of the <i class="package">mf-extra</i>
set.  There are, however, Type&nbsp;1 distributions of the EC&nbsp;fonts, so you
can switch to EC and use them; alternatives are discussed in
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-type1T1.html">8-bit Type&nbsp;1 fonts</a>.

<p>
Of course, commercial fixed-width fonts (even the default
<i class="fontname">Courier</i>) almost always come with a bold variant, so that&rsquo;s
not a problem.  Furthermore <a href="FAQ-usepsfont.html">PSNFSS</a>
will usually provide &ldquo;faked&rdquo; small caps fonts, and has no
compunctions about providing them in a bold form.  <i class="fontname">Courier</i>
is (as we all know, to our cost) freely available; a far more
presentable monospace font is <i class="fontname">LuxiMono</i>, which is also
freely available (monospace text in the typeset version of this
FAQ uses <i class="fontname">LuxiMono</i>, with the metrics and LaTeX
support available on the archive.
