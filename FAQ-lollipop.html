<p>
A long time ago (in the early 1990s), the Lollipop TeX format was
developed (originally to typeset the excellent book 
<a href="FAQ-tex-books.html">TeX by topic</a>).  Several people admired the
format, but no &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; of users appeared, that could have
prompted maintenance of the format.

<p>
More than 20 years later, a new maintainer appeared: he hopes to build
Lollipop into an engine for rapid document style development.  (In
addition, he intends to add support for right-to-left languages such
as his own&nbsp;&mdash; Persian.)

<p>
We can only hope that, this time, Lollipop will &ldquo;catch on&rdquo;!
