<h1>Preventing hyphenation of a particular word</h1>


<p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s quite possible for (<em>any</em>) hyphenation of a particular word
to seem &ldquo;completely wrong&rdquo;, so that you want to prevent it being
hyphenated.

<p>
If the word occurs in just one place, put it in a box:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\mbox{oddword}
</pre>
</blockquote>
(Plain TeX users should use <code>&#x5c;hbox</code>, and take care at the start
of paragraphs.)  However, boxing the word is not really advisable
unless you are sure it only occurs once.

<p>
If the word occurs commonly, the best choice is to assert an
hyphenation exception for it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\hyphenation{oddword}
</pre>
</blockquote>
This hyphenation exception (with no break points) will be used in
preference to what TeX&rsquo;s hyphenation algorithm may come up with.

<p>
In a multilingual document, repeat the exception specification for
each language the word may appear in.  So:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage[french,english]{babel}
\selectlanguage{english}
\hyphenation{oddword}
\selectlanguage{french}
\hyphenation{oddword}
</pre>
</blockquote>
(note that <i class="package">babel</i> will select the default language for the
document&nbsp;&mdash; English, in this case&nbsp;&mdash; at <code>&#x5c;begin</code><code>&#x7b;document&#x7d;</code>.)

<p>
A particular instance of this requirement is avoiding the hyphenation
of acronyms; a general rule for those that concoct acronyms seems to
be to make the capital-letter sequence read as near as is possible
like a &ldquo;real&rdquo; word, but hyphenating an acronym often looks silly.
The TeX control <code>&#x5c;uchyph</code> is designed for suppressing such
behaviour:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\uchyph=0
</pre>
</blockquote>
will stop hyphenation of upper-case words.  (Note that Plain TeX
syntax is needed here: there&rsquo;s no LaTeX alternative for setting
this value.)
