<h1>TeX User Groups</h1>


<p>

<p>
There has been a TeX User Group since very near the time TeX
first appeared.  That first group, TUG, is still active and its
journal <i class="slanted">TUGboat</i> continues in regular publication
with articles about TeX, MetaFont and related technologies, and about
document design, processing and production.  TUG holds a yearly
conference, whose proceedings are published in <i class="slanted">TUGboat</i>.

<p>
TUG&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.tug.org">web site</a> is a valuable
resource for all sorts of
TeX-related matters, such as details of TeX software, and lists
of TeX vendors and TeX consultants.  Back articles from
<i class="slanted">TUGboat</i> are also available.

<p>
Some time ago, TUG established a &ldquo;technical council&rdquo;, whose
task was to oversee the development of TeXnical projects.  Most
such projects nowadays go on their way without any support from
TUG, but TUG&rsquo;s web site lists its

organisation, but there are many national and regional user groups,
too; TUG&rsquo;s web site maintains a list of

<a href="http://www.tug.org/lugs.html">&ldquo;Local User Groups&rdquo; (LUGs)</a>.
