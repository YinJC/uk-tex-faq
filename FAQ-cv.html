<h1><em>Curriculum Vitae</em> (R&eacute;sum&eacute;)</h1>


<p>

<p>
Andrej Brodnik&rsquo;s class, <i class="class">vita</i>, offers a framework for producing
a <em>curriculum vitae</em>.  The class may be customised both for
subject (example class option files support both computer scientists
and singers), and for language (both the options provided are
available for both English and Slovene).  Extensions may be written by
creating new class option files, or by using macros defined in the
class to define new entry types, etc.

<p>
Didier Verna&rsquo;s class, <i class="class">curve</i>, is based on a model in which
the CV is made of a set of <em>rubrics</em> (each one dealing
with a major item that you want to discuss, such as &lsquo;education&rsquo;, &lsquo;work
experience&rsquo;, etc).  The class&rsquo;s documentation is supported by a couple
of example files, and an emacs mode is provided.

<p>
Xavier Danaux offers a class <i class="class">moderncv</i> which supports
typesetting modern <em>curricula vitarum</em>, both in a classic and in a
casual style. It is fairly customizable, allowing you to define your
own style by changing the colours, the fonts, etc.

<p>
The European Commission has recommended a format for 
<em>curricula vitarum</em> within Europe, and Nicola Vitacolonna has
developed a class <i class="class">europecv</i> to produce it.  While (by his own
admission) the class doesn&rsquo;t solve all problems, it seems well-thought
out and supports all current official EU languages (together with a
few non-official languages, such as Catalan, Galician and Serbian).

<p>
The alternative to using a separate class is to impose a package on
one of the standard classes.  An example,
Axel Reichert&rsquo;s <i class="package">currvita</i> package, has been recommended to the
FAQ team.  Its output certainly looks good.

<p>
There is also a LaTeX 2.09 package <i class="package">resume</i>, which comes with
little but advice <em>against</em> trying to use it.
