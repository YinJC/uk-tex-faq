<p>


<p>
In the past, package documentation used always to tell you to put your
files &ldquo;where LaTeX can find them&rdquo;; this was always unhelpful&nbsp;&mdash;
if you knew where that <em>was</em>, you didn&rsquo;t need telling, but if you
<em>didn&rsquo;t</em> know, you were completely stuck.

<p>
It was from this issue that the whole idea of the TDS sprang;
&ldquo;where to put&rdquo; questions now come down to &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the TDS
tree?&rdquo;.

<p>
We therefore answer the question by considering:
<ul>
<li> <a href="FAQ-what-TDS.html">what tree to use</a>, and
<li> <a href="FAQ-install-where.html">where in the tree to put the files</a>.
</ul>

<p>
Once we know the answer to both questions, and we&rsquo;ve created any
directories that are needed, we simply copy files to their rightful
location.

<p>
This has done what the old requirement specified: LaTeX (or
whatever) <em>can</em> (in principle) find the files.  However, in order
that the software <em>will</em> find the files, we need to update an
index file.

<p>
On a MiKTeX system, open the window
  <tt>Start</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>All Programs</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>MiKTeX &lsaquo;<i>version</i>&rsaquo;</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>Settings</tt>,
and click on <tt>Refresh FNDB</tt>.
The job may also be done in a command window, using the command:
<blockquote>
<pre>
initexmf --update-fndb
</pre>
</blockquote>
The 
<a href="http://docs.miktex.org/manual/initexmf.html">MiKTeX documentation</a>
gives further details about <tt>initexmf</tt>.

<p>
On a texlive-based system (or its predecessor teTeX, use the command
<tt>texhash</tt> (or if that&rsquo;s not available, <tt>mktexlsr</tt>&nbsp;&mdash;
they ought to be different names for the same program).

<p>
Having done all this, the new package will be available for use.
