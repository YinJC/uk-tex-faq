title: Cancelling terms in maths expressions
---

A technique used when explaining the behaviour of expressions or
equations (often for pedagogical purposes).  The [`cancel`](http://ctan.org/pkg/cancel)
package provides several variants of cancellation marks
(` `, `/` and `X`), and
a means of cancelling 'to' a particular value.

Documentation of [`cancel`](http://ctan.org/pkg/cancel) is in the package file.
