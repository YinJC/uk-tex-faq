<h1>What is LaTeX 2e?</h1>


<p>

<p>
Lamport&rsquo;s last version of LaTeX (LaTeX 2.09, last updated in 1992)
was superseded in 1994 by a new version (LaTeX 2e) provided by
<a href="FAQ-LaTeX3.html">the LaTeX team</a>.
LaTeX 2e is now the only readily-available version of
LaTeX, and draws together several threads of LaTeX development
from the later days of LaTeX 2.09.  The &ldquo;e&rdquo; of the name is (in the

<a href="FAQ-logos.html">official logo</a>)

a single-stroke epsilon
(&amp;epsilon;, supposedly
indicative of no more than a small change).

<p>
LaTeX 2e has several enhancements over LaTeX 2.09, but they were all
rather minor, with a view to continuity and stability rather than the
&ldquo;big push&rdquo; that some had expected from the team.  LaTeX 2e
continues to this day to offer a compatibility mode in which most
files prepared for use with LaTeX 2.09 will run (albeit with somewhat
reduced performance, and subject to voluminous complaints in the log
file).  Differences between LaTeX 2e and LaTeX 2.09 are
outlined in a series of &lsquo;guide&rsquo; files that are available in every
LaTeX distribution (the same directory also contains &ldquo;news&rdquo; about
each new release of LaTeX 2e).

<p>
Note that, now, LaTeX 2e is &ldquo;feature frozen&rdquo; (the only allowed
changes come from bug reports); this, too, is in pursuit of stability,
and is a driving force for many of the efforts to contribute LaTeX
packages.
