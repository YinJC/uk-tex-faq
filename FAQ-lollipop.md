# Lollipop

A long time ago (in the early 1990s), the Lollipop TeX format was
developed (originally to typeset the excellent book 
[TeX by topic](./FAQ-tex-books.html)).  Several people admired the
format, but no ''critical mass'' of users appeared, that could have
prompted maintenance of the format.

More than 20 years later, a new maintainer appeared: he hopes to build
Lollipop into an engine for rapid document style development.  (In
addition, he intends to add support for right-to-left languages such
as his own&nbsp;&mdash; Persian.)

We can only hope that, this time, Lollipop will ''catch on''!
