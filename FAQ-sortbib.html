<h1>Sorting lists of citations</h1>


<p>

<p>
BibTeX has a sorting function, and most BibTeX styles sort the
citation list they produce; most people find this desirable.

<p>
However, it is perfectly possible to write a
<code class="environment">thebibliography</code> environment that <em>looks</em> as if it
came from BibTeX, and many people do so (in order to save time in
the short term).

<p>
The problem arises when <code class="environment">thebibliography</code>-writers decide
their citations need to be sorted.  A common misapprehension is to
insert <code>&#x5c;bibliographystyle</code><code>&#x7b;alpha&#x7d;</code> (or similar) and expect
the typeset output to be sorted in some magical way.  BibTeX
doesn&rsquo;t work that way!&nbsp;&mdash; if you write <code class="environment">thebibliography</code>,
you get to sort its contents.  BibTeX will only sort the contents
of a <code class="environment">thebibliography</code> environment when it creates it, to
be inserted from a <code class="extension">bbl</code> file by a <code>&#x5c;bibliography</code> command.
