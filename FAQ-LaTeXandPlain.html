<h1>How does LaTeX relate to Plain TeX?</h1>


<p>

<p>
TeX provides a programming language (of sorts), and any document
more complex than the trivial &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; will need some
programming.

<p>
LaTeX and Plain TeX are both libraries written for use with
TeX; the user commands <i class="progname">tex</i> and <i class="progname">latex</i> invoke
TeX-the-program with a library incorporated.  Libraries that may be
loaded in this way are known as &lsquo;<em>formats</em>&rsquo;; when a user &ldquo;runs&rdquo;
Plain TeX or LaTeX, they are running TeX (the program) with an
appropriate format.  The documents are then programmed in Plain TeX
or LaTeX <em>language</em>.

<p>
Plain TeX and LaTeX exist because writing your documents in &lsquo;raw&rsquo;
TeX could involve much reinventing of wheels for every document.
Both languages serve as convenient aids to make document writing more
pleasant: LaTeX provides many more items to support &lsquo;common&rsquo;
requirements of documents.

<p>
As such, LaTeX is close to being a superset of Plain TeX, but
some Plain TeX commands don&rsquo;t work as expected when used in a
LaTeX document.  Using Plain TeX commands in a LaTeX document
is an occasional source of bugs: the output is <em>almost</em> right,
but some things are misplaced.

<p>
So, Plain TeX and LaTeX are related through a common parent, and
are designed for use in similar jobs; programming for one will often
not work correctly in the other.
