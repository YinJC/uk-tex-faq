title: Installing things on a (La)TeX system
---

Installing (or replacing) things on your (La)TeX system has the
potential to be rather complicated; the following questions attempt to
provide a step-by-step approach, starting from the point where you've
decided what it is that you want to install:
  

-  You must [find the file you need](./FAQ-install-find.html);
-  If you are going to install a LaTeX package, you may need to
    [unpack the distributed files](./FAQ-install-unpack.html);
-  It may be necessary to 
    [generate some documentation to read](./FAQ-install-doc.html);
-  You need to 
    [decide where to install the files](./FAQ-install-where.html);
-  You must now [install the files](./FAQ-inst-wlcf.html); and
    finally
-  You may need to [tidy up](./FAQ-inst-tidy.html) after the installation.
