<h1>How to get copyright, trademark, etc.</h1>


<p>

<p>
The &ldquo;
<a href="FAQ-symbols.html">Comprehensive symbol list</a>&rdquo;, lists
the symbol commands <code>&#x5c;textcopyright</code>,
<code>&#x5c;textregistered</code> and <code>&#x5c;texttrademark</code>, which are available in
TS1-encoded fonts, and which are enabled using the
<i class="package">textcomp</i> package.

<p>
In fact, all three commands are enabled in default LaTeX, but the
glyphs you get aren&rsquo;t terribly beautiful.  In particular,
<code>&#x5c;textregistered</code> behaves oddly when included in bold text (for
example, in a section heading), since it is composed of a small-caps
letter, which typically degrades to a regular shape letter when asked
to set in a bold font.  This means that the glyph becomes a circled
&ldquo;r&rdquo;, whereas the proper symbol is a circled &ldquo;R&rdquo;.

<p>
This effect is of course avoided by use of <i class="package">textcomp</i>.

<p>
Another problem arises if you want <code>&#x5c;textregistered</code> in a
superscript position (to look similar to <code>&#x5c;texttrademark</code>).
Using a maths-mode superscript to do this provokes lots of pointless
errors: you <em>must</em> use
<blockquote>
<pre>
\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
</pre>
</blockquote>
