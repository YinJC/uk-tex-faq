<h1>Changing the space between letters</h1>


<p>

<p>
A common technique in advertising copy (and other text whose actual
content need not actually be <em>read</em>) is to alter the space
between the letters (otherwise known as the tracking).  As a general
rule, this is a very bad idea: it detracts from legibility, which is
contrary to the principles of typesetting (any respectable font you
might be using should already have optimum tracking built into it).

<p>
The great type designer, Eric Gill, is credited with saying &ldquo;he who
would letterspace lower-case text, would steal sheep&rdquo;.  (The
attribution is probably apocryphal: others are also credited with the
remark.  Stealing sheep was, in the 19th century, a capital offence in
Britain.)  As the remark suggests, though, letterspacing of upper-case
text is less awful a crime; the technique used also to be used for
emphasis of text set in Fraktur (or similar) fonts.

<p>
Straightforward macros (usable, in principle, with any TeX macro
package) may be found in <i class="package">letterspacing</i> (which is the name of
the <code class="extension">tex</code> file).

<p>



<p>
A more comprehensive solution is to be found in the <i class="package">soul</i>
package (which is optimised for use with LaTeX, but also works with
Plain TeX).  Soul also permits hyphenation of letterspaced text;
Gill&rsquo;s view of such an activity is not (even apocryphally) recorded.
(Spacing-out forms part of the name of <i class="package">soul</i>; the other half
is described in <a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-underline.html">another question</a>.)

<p>
Possibly the &lsquo;ultimate&rsquo; in this field is the <i class="package">microtype</i>,
which uses the micro-typography capabilities of current PDFTeX to
provide a <code>&#x5c;textls</code> command, which operates according to parameters
declared in a <code>&#x5c;SetTracking</code> command.  <i class="package">Microtype</i>&rsquo;s
&lsquo;tracking&rsquo; facility expands the natural spacing of the font itself,
rather than inserting space between characters.  Ordinarily,
letter-spacing will destroy ligatures; however, this is <em>wrong</em>
for some font styles (for example, <i class="fontname">fraktur</i>), and the
package provides a means of protecting the ligatures in a
letter-spaced text.
