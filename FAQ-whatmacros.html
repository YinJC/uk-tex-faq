<p>

<p>
TeX is a <em>macro processor</em>: this is a computer-science-y term
meaning &ldquo;text expander&rdquo; (more or less); TeX typesets text as it
goes along, but <em>expands</em> each macro it finds.  TeX&rsquo;s macros
may include instructions to TeX itself, on top of the simple text
generation one might expect.

<p>
Macros are a <em>good thing</em>, since they allow the user to
manipulate documents according to context.  For example, the macro
<code>&#x5c;TeX</code> is usually defined to produce &ldquo;TEX&rdquo; with the &lsquo;E&rsquo; lowered
(the original idea was Knuth&rsquo;s),
but in these FAQs the default definition of the macro is
overridden, and it simply expands to the letters &ldquo;TeX&rdquo;.  (<em>You</em>
may not think this a good thing, but the author of the macros has his
reasons&nbsp;&ndash; see <a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-logos.html">TeX-related logos</a>.)

<p>
Macro names are conventionally built from a <tt>&#x5c; </tt>
followed by a sequence of letters, which may be upper or lower case
(as in <code>&#x5c;TeX</code>, mentioned above).  They may also be 
<tt>&#x5c; &lsaquo;<i>any single character</i>&rsaquo;</tt>, which allows all
sorts of oddities (many built in to most TeX macro sets, all the
way up from the apparently simple &lsquo;<code>&#x5c; </code>&rsquo; meaning &ldquo;insert a space
here&rdquo;).

<p>
Macro programming can be a complicated business, but at their very
simplest they need little introduction&nbsp;&mdash; you&rsquo;ll hardly need to be
told that:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\def\foo{bar}
</pre>
</blockquote>
replaces each instance of <code>&#x5c;foo</code> with the text &ldquo;bar&rdquo;.  The
command <code>&#x5c;def</code> is Plain TeX syntax for defining commands;
LaTeX offers a macro <code>&#x5c;newcommand</code> that goes some way towards
protecting users from themselves, but basically does the same thing:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\newcommand{\foo}{bar}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Macros may have &ldquo;arguments&rdquo; , which are used to substitute for marked
bits of the macro expansion:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\def\foo#1{This is a #1 bar}
...
\foo{2/4}.
</pre>
</blockquote>
which produces:
<blockquote>
  This is a 2/4 bar.
</blockquote>
or, in LaTeX speak:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\newcommand{\foo}[1]{This is a #1 bar}
...
\foo{3/4}.
</pre>
</blockquote>
which produces:
<blockquote>
  This is 3/4 bar.
</blockquote>
(LaTeX users waltz through life, perhaps?)

<p>
You will have noticed that the arguments, above, were enclosed in
braces (<tt>&#x7b;&hellip;&#x7d;</tt>); this is the
normal way of typing arguments, though TeX is enormously flexible,
and you may find all sorts of other ways of passing arguments (if you
stick with it).

<p>
Macro writing can get very complicated, very quickly.  If you are a
beginner (La)TeX programmer, you are well advised to read something
along the lines of the <a href="FAQ-tex-books.html">TeXbook</a>; once you&rsquo;re under
way, <a href="FAQ-ol-books.html">TeX by Topic</a> is possibly a more satisfactory
choice.  Rather a lot of the answers in these FAQs tell you
about various issues of how to write macros.
