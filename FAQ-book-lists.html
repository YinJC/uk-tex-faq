<h1>Books relevant to TeX and friends</h1>

<p>
There are too many books for them all to appear in a single list, so
the following answers aim to cover &ldquo;related&rdquo; books, with subject
matter as follows:
<ul>
<li> <a href="FAQ-tex-books.html">TeX itself and Plain TeX</a>
<li> <a href="FAQ-latex-books.html">LaTeX</a>
<li> <a href="FAQ-other-books.html">Books on other TeX-related matters</a>
<li> <a href="FAQ-type-books.html">Books on Type</a>
</ul>

<p>
These lists only cover books in English: notices of new books, or
warnings that books are now out of print are always welcome.  However,
these FAQs do <em>not</em> carry reviews of current published
material.
