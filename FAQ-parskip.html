<h1>Zero paragraph indent</h1>


<p>

<p>
The conventional way of typesetting running text has no separation
between paragraphs, and the first line of each paragraph in a block of
text indented.

<p>
In contrast, one common convention for typewritten text was to have no
indentation of paragraphs; such a style is often required for
&ldquo;brutalist&rdquo; publications such as technical manuals, and in styles
that hanker after typewritten manuscripts, such as
officially-specified dissertation formats.

<p>
Anyone can see, after no more than a moment&rsquo;s thought, that if the
paragraph indent is zero, the paragraphs must be separated by blank
space: otherwise it is sometimes going to be impossible to see the
breaks between paragraphs.

<p>
The simple-minded approach to zero paragraph indentation is thus:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{\baselineskip}
</pre>
</blockquote>
and in the very simplest text, it&rsquo;s a fine solution.

<p>
However, the non-zero <code>&#x5c;parskip</code> interferes with lists and the like,
and the result looks pretty awful.  The <i class="package">parskip</i> package
patches things up to look reasonable; it&rsquo;s not perfect, but it deals
with most problems.

<p>
The Netherlands Users&rsquo; Group&rsquo;s set of classes includes an
<i class="class">article</i> equivalent (<i class="class">artikel3</i>) and a <i class="class">report</i>
equivalent (<i class="class">rapport3</i>) whose design incorporates zero paragraph
indent and non-zero paragraph skip.
