Thesis styles are usually very specific to your University, so it&rsquo;s
usually not profitable to ask around for a package outside your own
University.  Since many Universities (in their eccentric way) still
require double-spaced thesis text, you may also need separately to set
up <a href="FAQ-linespace.html">double spacing</a>.

<p>
If you want to write a new thesis class of your own, a good place to
start is the University of California style, but remember that it&rsquo;s
often difficult to produce a thesis that both looks good and conforms
with the style that your Univeristy demands.
