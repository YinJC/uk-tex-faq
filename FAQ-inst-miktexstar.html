<h1>Installation using MiKTeX package manager</h1>


<p>
[[[AliasQuestion]]][[[LBRACE]]]Q-inst-miktex[[[RBRACE]]]

<p>
Packages for use with MiKTeX are maintained very efficiently by the
project managers (new packages and updates on CTAN ordinarily
make their way to the MiKTeX package repository within a week).
Thus it makes sense for the MiKTeX user to take advantage of the
system rather than grinding through the steps of installation.

<p>
MiKTeX maintains a database of packages it &ldquo;knows about&rdquo;,
together with (coded) installation instructions that enable it to
install the packages with minimal user intervention; you can update
the database over the internet.

<p>
If MiKTeX does know about a package you need installed, it&rsquo;s worth
using the system:
first, open the MiKTeX packages window: click on
  <tt>Start</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>Programs</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>MiKTeX</tt>&rarr;
  <tt>MiKTeX Options</tt>, and select the
  <tt>Packages</tt> tab.

<p>
On the tab, there is an Explorer-style display of packages.
Right-click on the root of the tree, &ldquo;<tt>MiKTeX Packages</tt>&rdquo;,
and select &ldquo;<tt>Search</tt>&rdquo;: enter the name of the package you&rsquo;re
interested in, and press the &ldquo;<tt>Search</tt>&rdquo; button.  If
MiKTeX knows about your package, it will open up the tree to show
you a tick box for your package: check that box.

<p>
If you prefer a command-line utility, there&rsquo;s <i class="progname">mpm</i>.  Open a
command shell, and type:
<blockquote>
<pre>
mpm --install=<package>
</pre>
</blockquote>
(which of course assumes you know the name by which MiKTeX refers to
your package).
