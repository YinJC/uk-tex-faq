# Books relevant to TeX and friends




There are too many books for them all to appear in a single list, so
the following answers aim to cover ''related'' books, with subject
matter as follows:
  

-  [TeX itself and Plain TeX](./FAQ-tex-books.html)
-  [LaTeX](./FAQ-latex-books.html)
-  [Books on other TeX-related matters](./FAQ-other-books.html)
-  [Books on Type](./FAQ-type-books.html)




These lists only cover books in English: notices of new books, or
warnings that books are now out of print are always welcome.  However,
these FAQs do _not_ carry reviews of current published
material.
