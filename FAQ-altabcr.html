<h1>Alignment tab changed to <code>&#x5c;cr</code></h1>

<p>
This is an error you may encounter in LaTeX when a tabular
environment is being processed.  &ldquo;Alignment tabs&rdquo; are the
<tt>&amp;</tt> signs that separate the columns of a <code class="environment">tabular</code>
(or <code class="environment">array</code> or matrix) environment; so the error message
<blockquote>
<pre>
! Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr
</pre>
</blockquote>
could arise from a simple typo, such as:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  hello   &amp; there &amp; jim \\
  goodbye &amp; now
\end{tabular}
</pre>
</blockquote>
where the second <tt>&amp;</tt> in the first line of the table is more than the
two-column <tt>ll</tt> column specification can cope with. In this
case, an extra &ldquo;<tt>l</tt>&rdquo; in that solves the problem.  (If you
continue from the error in this case, &ldquo;<tt>jim</tt>&rdquo; will be moved
to a row of his own.)  Another simple typo that can provoke the error
is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  hello   &amp; there
  goodbye &amp; now
\end{tabular}
</pre>
</blockquote>
where the &lsquo;<tt>&#x5c; </tt>&rsquo; has been missed from the first line of the table.
In this case, if you continue from the error, you will find that
LaTeX has made a table equivalent to:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  hello   &amp; there goodbye\\
  now
\end{tabular}
</pre>
</blockquote>
(with the second line of the table having only one cell).

<p>
Rather more difficult to spot is the occurrence of the error when
you&rsquo;re using alignment instructions in a &ldquo;<tt>p</tt>&rdquo; column:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage{array}
...
\begin{tabular}{l>{\raggedright}p{2in}}
here &amp; we are again \\
happy &amp; as can be
\end{tabular}
</pre>
</blockquote>
the problem here (as explained in 
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-tabcellalign.html">tabular cell alignment</a>) is that the
<code>&#x5c;raggedright</code> command in the column specification has overwritten
<code class="environment">tabular</code>&rsquo;s definition of <tt>&#x5c; </tt>, so that
&ldquo;<tt>happy</tt>&rdquo; appears in a new line of the second column, and the
following <tt>&amp;</tt> appears to LaTeX just like the second
<tt>&amp;</tt> in the first example above.

<p>
Get rid of the error in the way described in 
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-tabcellalign.html">tabular cell alignment</a>&nbsp;&mdash; either use
<code>&#x5c;tabularnewline</code> explicitly, or use the <code>&#x5c;RBS</code> trick described
there.

<p>
The <i class="package">amsmath</i> package adds a further twist; when typesetting
a matrix (the package provides many matrix environments), it has a
fixed maximum number of columns in a matrix&nbsp;&mdash; exceed that maximum,
and the error will appear.  By default, the maximum is set to 10, but
the value is stored in counter <tt>MaxMatrixCols</tt> and may be
changed (in the same way as any counter):
<blockquote>
<pre>
\setcounter{MaxMatrixCols}{20}
</pre>
</blockquote>
