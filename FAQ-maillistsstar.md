The previous question, ''[getting help](./FAQ-gethelp.html)'', talked of
the two major forums in which (La)TeX, MetaFont and MetaPost are
discussed; however, these aren't the only ones available.

The TUG web site offers many mailing lists other than just
`texhax` via its 
[mail list management page](http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo).

The French national TeX user group, Gutenberg, offers a MetaFont (and,
de facto, MetaPost) mailing list, <a href="mailto:metafont@ens.fr">metafont@ens.fr</a>: subscribe to
it by sending a message
```latex
subscribe metafont
```
to <a href="mailto:sympa@ens.fr">sympa@ens.fr</a>

(Note that there's also a MetaPost-specific mailing list available via the
TUG list server; in fact there's little danger of becoming confused
by subscribing to both.)

Announcements of TeX-related installations on the CTAN
archives are sent to the mailing list `ctan-ann`.  Subscribe
to the list via its `MailMan` web-site
[https://lists.dante.de/mailman/listinfo/ctan-ann]; list archives
are available at the same address.  An RSS feed is available at
[http://ctan.org/ctan-ann].
