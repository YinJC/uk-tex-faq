<p>
Fonts are really &ldquo;just another package&rdquo;, and so should be installed
in the same sort of way as packages.  However, fonts tend to be more
complicated than the average package, and as a result it&rsquo;s sometimes
difficult to see the overall structure.

<p>
Font files may appear in any of a large number of different formats;
each format has a different function in a TeX system, and each is
stored in a directory its own sub-tree in the installation&rsquo;s
TDS tree; all these sub-trees have the directory
<i class="filename">$TEXMF/fonts</i> 
as their root.  A sequence of answers describes the
installation of fonts:
