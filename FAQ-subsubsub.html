<h1>How to create a <code>&#x5c;subsubsubsection</code></h1>


<p>

<p>
LaTeX&rsquo;s set of &ldquo;sections&rdquo; stops at the level of
<code>&#x5c;subsubsection</code>.  This reflects a design decision by Lamport&nbsp;&mdash;
for, after all, who can reasonably want a section with such huge
strings of numbers in front of it?

<p>
In fact, LaTeX standard classes <em>do</em> define &ldquo;sectioning&rdquo;
levels lower than <code>&#x5c;subsubsection</code>, but they don&rsquo;t format them like
sections (they&rsquo;re not numbered, and the text is run-in after the
heading).  These deeply inferior section commands are <code>&#x5c;paragraph</code>
and <code>&#x5c;subparagraph</code>; you can (if you <em>must</em>) arrange that these
two commands produce numbered headings, so that you can use them as
<code>&#x5c;subsubsubsection</code>s and lower.

<p>
The <i class="package">titlesec</i> package provides a sensible set of macros for
you to adjust the definitions of the sectioning macros, and it may be
used to transform a <code>&#x5c;paragraph</code>&rsquo;s typesetting so that it looks
like that of a <code>&#x5c;section</code>.

<p>
If you want to program the change yourself, you&rsquo;ll find that the
commands (<code>&#x5c;section</code> all the way down to <code>&#x5c;subparagraph</code>) are
defined in terms of the internal <code>&#x5c;@startsection</code> command, which
takes 6&nbsp;arguments.  Before attempting this sort of work, you are well
advised to read the LaTeX sources (<i class="filename">ltsect.dtx</i> in the
LaTeX distribution) and the source of the standard packages
(<i class="filename">classes.dtx</i>), or to make use of the 
<a href="FAQ-latex-books.html">LaTeX Companion</a>, which
discusses the use of <code>&#x5c;@startsection</code> for this sort of thing.

<p>
You will note that Lamport didn&rsquo;t go on adding &ldquo;<tt>sub</tt>&rdquo; to the
names of sectioning commands, when creating commands for the lowest
levels of a document.  This would seem sensible to any but the most
rigorous stickler for symmetry&nbsp;&mdash; it would surely challenge pretty
much anyone&rsquo;s reading of the source of a document, if there was a need
to distinguish <code>&#x5c;subsubsubsection</code> and <code>&#x5c;subsubsubsubsection</code>
