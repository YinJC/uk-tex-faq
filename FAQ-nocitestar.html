<h1>Listing all your BibTeX entries</h1>


<p>

<p>
LaTeX and BibTeX co-operate to offer special treatment of this
requirement.  The command <code>&#x5c;nocite</code><code>&#x7b;*&#x7d;</code> is specially treated,
and causes BibTeX to generate bibliography entries for every entry
in each <code class="extension">bib</code> file listed in your <code>&#x5c;bibliography</code> statement, so
that after a LaTeX&ndash;BibTeX&ndash;LaTeX sequence, you have a
document with the whole thing listed.

<p>
Note that LaTeX <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> produce

&ldquo;<tt>Citation ... undefined</tt>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<tt>There were undefined references</tt>&rdquo; warnings in respect of
<code>&#x5c;nocite</code><code>&#x7b;*&#x7d;</code>.  This isn&rsquo;t a problem if you&rsquo;re running
LaTeX &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; (you <em>know</em> exactly how many times you have
to run things), but the lack might confuse automatic processors that
scan the log file to determine whether another run is necessary.

<p>
A couple of packages are available, that aim to reduce the impact of
<code>&#x5c;nocite</code><code>&#x7b;*&#x7d;</code> of a large citation database.  <i class="package">Biblist</i>
was written for use under LaTeX 2.09, but seems to work well enough;
<i class="package">listbib</i> is more modern.  Both provide their own
<code class="extension">bst</code> files.  (The impact of large databases was significant
in the old days of LaTeX systems with very little free memory; this
problem is less significant now than it once was.)
