<h1>Getting started</h1>


<p>

<p>
(La)TeX offers a very large number of choices, and the beginner has
to navigate through that set before even taking his first steps.  The
aim here is to guide the beginner through a set of answers that may
help the process.  We assume the beginner &lsquo;knows&rsquo; that (La)TeX is
for them; if not, the discussion &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-whatTeX.html">what is TeX</a>&rdquo;
may help.

<p>
To start at the very beginning, then, the beginner may wish to know
what all those 
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-texthings.html">things with TeX in their name are</a>&rdquo;.

<p>
Armed with that knowledge, the beginner needs to decide what macro
format she needs (always assuming someone hasn&rsquo;t already told her she
needs to use &ldquo;fooTeX&rdquo;.  Learn about the alternatives in answers
discussing common formats: look at 
<a href="FAQ-plaintex.html">writing Plain TeX</a>,
<a href="FAQ-latex.html">LaTeX</a> or
<a href="FAQ-context.html">Context</a>.

<p>
If no system has been provided, the beginner needs to acquire a TeX
distribution appropriate to their machine.  Available options are
available via the answer 
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-TeXsystems.html">(La)TeX for various machines</a>&rdquo;; we assume
here that the beginner can install things for herself, or has access
to someone who can.

<p>
Finally, the beginner needs to get started in the chosen format.  For
Plain TeX, see &ldquo;<a class="FA.html" href="FAQ-man-tex.html">Online introductions: TeX</a>&rdquo;;
for LaTeX, see 
&ldquo;<a class="FA.html" href="FAQ-man-latex.html">Online introductions: LaTeX</a>&rdquo;; and for
Context, the place to start is the 
<a href="http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page">ConTeXt garden wiki</a>
(which is so good the present FAQs don&rsquo;t even try to compete).
