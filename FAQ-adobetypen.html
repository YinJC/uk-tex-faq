Adobe has specified a number of formats for files to represent fonts
in PostScript files; this question doesn&rsquo;t attempt to be encyclopaedic, so
we only discuss the two formats most commonly encountered in the
(La)TeX context, types&nbsp;1 and 3.  In particular, we don&rsquo;t discuss the
OpenType format, whose many advantages now becoming accessible to most
(La)TeX users (by means of

  the widely-used <a href="FAQ-xetex.html">XeTeX</a> and the more experimental
  <a href="FAQ-luatex.html">LuaTeX</a>).






<p>
Adobe Type&nbsp;1 format specifies a means to represent outlines of the glyphs
in a font.  The &lsquo;language&rsquo; used is closely restricted, to ensure that
the font is rendered as quickly as possible.  (Or rather, as quickly
as possible with Adobe&rsquo;s technology at the time the specification was
written: the structure could well be different if it were specified
now.)  The format has long been the basis of the digital type-foundry
business, though nowadays most new fonts are released in OpenType format.

<p>
In the (La)TeX context, Type&nbsp;1 fonts are extremely important.  Apart
from their simple 
availability (there are thousands of commercial Type&nbsp;1 text fonts around), the
commonest reader for PDF files has long (in effect) <em>insisted</em> on
their use (see below).

<p>
Type&nbsp;3 fonts have a more forgiving specification.  A wide range of
PostScript operators is permissible, including bitmap specifiers.  Type&nbsp;3
is therefore the natural format to be used for programs such as
<i class="progname">dvips</i> when they auto-generate something to represent
MetaFont-generated fonts in a PostScript file.  It&rsquo;s Adobe Acrobat Viewer&rsquo;s
treatment of bitmap Type&nbsp;3 fonts that has made direct MetaFont output
increasingly unattractive, in recent years.  If you have a PDF
document in which the text looks fuzzy and uneven in Acrobat Reader,
ask Reader for the <tt>File</tt>&rarr;
<tt>Document Properties</tt>&rarr;
<tt>Fonts ...</tt>, and it will likely show some font or other as
&ldquo;Type&nbsp;3&rdquo; (usually with encoding &ldquo;Custom&rdquo;).  The problem has
disappeared with version 6 of Acrobat Reader.  See 
<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-dvips-pdf.html">PDF quality</a> for a discussion of
the issue, and for ways of addressing it.

<p>
Type&nbsp;3 fonts should not entirely be dismissed, however.  Acrobat
Reader&rsquo;s failure with them is entirely derived from its failure to use
the anti-aliasing techniques common in TeX-ware.  Choose a
different set of PostScript graphical operators, and you can make pleasing
Type&nbsp;3 fonts that don&rsquo;t &ldquo;annoy&rdquo; Reader.  For example, you may not
change colour within a Type&nbsp;1 font glyph, but there&rsquo;s no such
restriction on a Type&nbsp;3 font, which opens opportunities for some
startling effects.
