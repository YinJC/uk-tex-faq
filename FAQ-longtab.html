<h1>Tables longer than a single page</h1>


<p>

<p>
Tables are, by default, set entirely in boxes of their own: as a
result, they won&rsquo;t split over a page boundary.  Sadly, the world keeps
turning up tables longer than a single page that we need to typeset.

<p>
For simple tables (whose shape is highly regular), the simplest
solution may well be to use the <code class="environment">tabbing</code> environment,
which is slightly tedious to set up, but which doesn&rsquo;t force the whole alignment
onto a single page.

<p>
The <i class="package">longtable</i> package builds the whole table (in chunks), in
a first pass, and then uses information it has written to the <code class="extension">aux</code>
file during later passes to get the setting &ldquo;right&rdquo; (the package
ordinarily manages to set tables in just two passes).  Since the
package has overview of the whole table at the time it&rsquo;s doing
&ldquo;final&rdquo; setting, the table is set &ldquo;uniformly&rdquo; over its entire
length, with columns matching on consecutive pages.
<i class="package">longtable</i> has a reputation for failing to interwork with
other packages, but it does work with <i class="package">colortbl</i>, and its
author has provided the <i class="package">ltxtable</i> package to provide (most
of) the facilities of <i class="package">tabularx</i> (see

<a class="FAquestion.html" href="FAQ-fixwidtab.html">fixed-width tables</a>) for long tables:
beware of its rather curious usage constraints&nbsp;&mdash; each long table
should be in a file of its own, and included by
<code>&#x5c;LTXtable</code><code>&#x7b;width&#x7d;</code></code><code>&#x7b;file&#x7d;</code>.  Since <i class="package">longtable</i>&rsquo;s
multiple-page tables can&rsquo;t possibly live inside floats, the package
provides for captions within the <code class="environment">longtable</code> environment
itself.

<p>
A seeming alternative to <i class="package">ltxtable</i> is <i class="package">ltablex</i>; but
it is outdated and not fully functional.  Its worst problem is its
strictly limited memory capacity (<i class="package">longtable</i> is not so
limited, at the cost of much complication in its code);
<i class="package">ltablex</i> can only deal with relatively small tables, it doesn&rsquo;t seem
likely that support is available; but its user interface is much
simpler than <i class="package">ltxtable</i>, so if its restrictions aren&rsquo;t a
problem for you, it may be worth a try.

<p>
The <i class="package">supertabular</i> package starts and stops a
<code class="environment">tabular</code> environment for each page of the table.  As a
result, each &lsquo;page worth&rsquo; of the table is compiled independently, and
the widths of corresponding columns may differ on successive pages.
However, if the correspondence doesn&rsquo;t matter, or if your columns are
fixed-width, <i class="package">supertabular</i> has the great advantage of doing
its job in a single run.

<p>
Both <i class="package">longtable</i> and <i class="package">supertabular</i> allow definition
of head- and footlines for the table; <i class="package">longtable</i> allows
distinction of the first and last head and foot.

<p>
The <i class="package">xtab</i> package fixes some infelicities of
<i class="package">supertabular</i>, and also provides a &ldquo;last head&rdquo; facility
(though this, of course, destroys <i class="package">supertabular</i>&rsquo;s advantage
of operating in a single run).

<p>
The <i class="package">stabular</i> package provides a simple-to-use &ldquo;extension to
<code class="environment">tabular</code>&rdquo; that allows it to typeset tables that run over
the end of a page; it also has usability extensions, but doesn&rsquo;t have
the head- and footline capabilities of the major packages.

<p>
Documentation of <i class="package">ltablex</i> is to be found in the package file.
