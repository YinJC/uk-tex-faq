<h1>WIKI books for TeX and friends</h1>


<p>

<p>
The <em>WIKI</em> concept can be a boon to everyone, if used sensibly.
The &ldquo;general&rdquo; WIKI allows <em>anyone</em> to add stuff, or to edit
stuff that someone else has added: while there is obvious potential
for chaos, there is evidence that a strong user community can keep a
WIKI under control.

<p>
Following the encouraging performance of the 
<a href="http://contextgarden.net/.html">CONTeXT WIKI</a>, valiant
efforts have been made generating &ldquo;WIKI books&rdquo; for (La)TeX
users.  Thus we have 
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/TeX.html">(Plain) TeX WIKI book</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX.html">LaTeX WIKI book</a>&nbsp;&mdash;
both well established.  Both are highly rated as reference sources,
and even as introductory texts.
