<h1>Online introductions: LaTeX</h1>


<p>

<p>
A pleasing little document, &ldquo;Getting something out of LaTeX&rdquo; is
designed to give a feel of LaTeX to someone who&rsquo;s never used it at
all.  It&rsquo;s not a tutorial, merely helps the user to decide whether to
go on to a tutorial, and thence to &lsquo;real&rsquo; use of LaTeX.

<p>
Tobias Oetiker&rsquo;s &lsquo;(Not so) Short Introduction to LaTeX 2e&rsquo;, is
regularly updated, as people suggest better ways of explaining things,
etc.  The introduction is available on CTAN, together with
translations into a rather large set of languages.

<p>
Peter Flynn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beginner&rsquo;s LaTeX&rdquo; (which started life as course
material) is a pleasing read.  A complete copy may be found on
CTAN, but it may also be browsed over the web
(<a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/beginlatex/html/">http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/beginlatex/html/</a>).

<p>
Harvey Greenberg&rsquo;s &lsquo;Simplified Introduction to LaTeX&rsquo; was written
for a lecture course, and is also available on CTAN (in PostScript
only, unfortunately).

<p>
The fourth edition of George Gr\"atzer&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Math into LaTeX&rdquo;
contains a &ldquo;short course&rdquo; in LaTeX itself, and that course has
been made publicly available on CTAN.

<p>
Philip Hirschhorn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Getting up and running with AMSLaTeX&rdquo; has a
brief introduction to LaTeX itself, followed by a substantial
introduction to the use of the AMS classes and the
<i class="package">amsmath</i> package and other things that are potentially of
interest to those writing documents containing mathematics.

<p>
Edith Hodgen&rsquo;s 
<a href="http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~david/latex/notes.pdf">LaTeX, a Braindump</a>
starts you from the ground up&nbsp;&mdash; giving a basic tutorial in the use
of <i class="progname">Linux</i> to get you going (rather a large file&hellip;).
Its parent site, David Friggens&rsquo; 
<a href="http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~david/latex/">documentation page</a> is a
useful collection of links in itself.

<p>

<a href="http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/">Andy Roberts&rsquo; introductory material</a>
is a pleasing short introduction to the use of (La)TeX; some of the
slides for <em>actual</em> tutorials are to be found on the page, as
well.

<p>
D. R.&nbsp;Wilkins&rsquo; 
<a href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/">&lsquo;Getting started with LaTeX&rsquo;</a>
also looks good (it appears shorter&nbsp;&mdash; more of a primer&nbsp;&mdash; than some
of the other offerings).

<p>
Chris Harrison&rsquo;s 
<a href="http://xoph.co/20111024/latex-tutorial/">LaTeX tutorial</a>
presents basic LaTeX in a rather pleasing and straightforward way.

<p>
Nicola Talbot&rsquo;s 
<a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/novices/">LaTeX for complete novices</a>
does what it claims: the author teaches LaTeX at the University of
East Anglia.  The &ldquo;Novices&rdquo; tutorial is one of several 
<a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/">introductory tutorials</a>,
which include exercises (with solutions).  Other tutorials include
those for 
<a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/thesis/">writing theses/dissertations with LaTeX</a>, and for 
<a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/admin/">using LaTeX in administrative work</a>

<p>
Engelbert Buxbaum provides the &lsquo;slides&rsquo; for his LaTeX course &lsquo;The
LaTeX document preparation system&rsquo;; this seems to be a departmental
course at his university.

<p>
Mark van Dongen&rsquo;s 
<a href=""http://csweb.ucc.ie/~dongen/LaTeX-and-Friends.pdf">&lsquo;LaTeX and friends&rsquo;</a>
appeared as he was writing his book on the subject (soon to be published).

<p>
An interesting (and practical) tutorial about what <em>not</em> to do is
<i class="package">l2tabu</i>, or &ldquo;A list of sins of LaTeX 2e users&rdquo; by Mark
Trettin, translated into English by J\"urgen Fenn.  The
tutorial is available from CTAN as a PDF file (though
the source is also available).
