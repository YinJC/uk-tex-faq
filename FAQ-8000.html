<p>

<p>
You&rsquo;re running <i class="progname">dvips</i>, and you encounter a stream of error
messages, starting with &ldquo;<tt>Mismatched mode</tt>&rdquo;.  The mode is the
default used in your installation&nbsp;&mdash; it&rsquo;s set in the <i class="progname">dvips</i>
configuration file, and <tt>ljfour</tt> is commonest (since it&rsquo;s the
default in most distributions), but not invariable.

<p>
The problem is that <i class="progname">dvips</i> has encountered a font for which
it must generate a bitmap (since it can&rsquo;t find it in Type&nbsp;1 format),
and there is no proforma available to provide instructions to give to
MetaFont.

<p>
So what to do?  The number 8000 comes from the &lsquo;<tt>-Ppdf</tt>&rsquo; option
to <i class="progname">dvips</i>, which you might have found from the answer

<a href="FAQ-fuzzy-type3.html">&ldquo;wrong type of fonts&rdquo;</a>.  The obvious
solution is to switch to the trivial substitute &lsquo;<tt>-Pwww</tt>&rsquo;,
which selects the necessary type&nbsp;1 fonts for PDF generation,
but nothing else: however, this will leave you with undesirable bitmap
fonts in your PDF file.  The &ldquo;proper&rdquo; solution is to find a
way of expressing what you want to do, using type&nbsp;1 fonts.
