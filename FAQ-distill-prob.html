<h1>Characters missing from PDF output</h1>


<p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re using <i class="progname">Acrobat</i> <i class="progname">Distiller</i> to create your
PDF output, you may find
characters missing.  This may manifest
itself as messed-up maths equations (missing
&ldquo;-&rdquo; signs, for example), or bits missing
from large symbols.  Early versions of <i class="progname">Distiller</i> used to
ignore character positions 0&ndash;31 and 128&ndash;159 of every font: Adobe&rsquo;s
fonts never use such positions, so why should <i class="progname">Distiller</i>?

<p>
Well, the answer to this question is &ldquo;because Adobe don&rsquo;t produce all
the world&rsquo;s fonts&rdquo;&nbsp;&mdash; fonts like <i class="fontname">Computer</i>
<i class="fontname">Modern</i> were around before Adobe came on the scene, and
<em>they</em> use positions 0&ndash;31.  Adobe don&rsquo;t react to complaints like
that in the previous sentence, but they do release new versions of
their programs; and <i class="progname">Distiller</i>, since at least version&nbsp;4.0,
<em>has</em> recognised the font positions it used to shun.

<p>
Meanwhile, TeX users with old versions of <i class="progname">Distiller</i> need
to deal with their fonts.  <i class="progname">Dvips</i> comes to our aid: the
switch <tt>-G1</tt> (&ldquo;remap characters&rdquo;), which moves the offending
characters out of the way.  The PDF configuration file
(<tt>-Ppdf</tt>), recommended 
in &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-fuzzy-type3.html">the wrong type of fonts</a>&rdquo;,
includes the switch.

<p>
The switch is not without its problems; pre-2003 versions of
<i class="progname">dvips</i> will apply it to Adobe fonts as well, causing
<a href="FAQ-charshift.html">havoc</a>, but fortunately
that problem is usually soluble.  However, a document using both
CM and Adobe-specified fonts is stuck.  The only real solution
is either to upgrade <i class="progname">dvips</i>, or to spend money to upgrade
<i class="progname">Distiller</i>.
