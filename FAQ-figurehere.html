<p>

<p>
This is of course a contradiction: <code class="environment">figure</code> and
<code class="environment">table</code> are <em>designed</em> to float, and will always have
the potential to appear away from where you asked for them.  Therefore
you need something that behaves like a <code class="environment">figure</code> or
<code class="environment">table</code> environment, except that it doesn&rsquo;t allow the
figure or table to float.

<p>
The most straightforward way is to use of the <i class="package">float</i> package;
it gives you a <tt>[H]</tt> float placement option that prevents
floating:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{foo}
  \caption{caption text}
  \label{fig:nonfloat}
\end{figure}
</pre>
</blockquote>
As the example suggests, such a &lsquo;<tt>[H]</tt>&rsquo; figure (or
corresponding table) offers all you need to cross-reference as well
as typeset.  (The package <i class="package">here</i> provides the same function,
but is no longer recommended.)

<p>
However, you don&rsquo;t actually <em>have</em> to use <i class="package">float</i> (or
<i class="package">here</i>) since it is, in fact, doing rather little for you.
You can place your figure as you please, with a sequence like
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{foo}
  \captionof{figure}{caption text}
  \label{fig:nonfloat}
\end{center}
</pre>
</blockquote>
which relies on the <code>&#x5c;captionof</code> command to place a caption without
benefit of an enclosing float.  That command may be had from the extremely
simple-minded package <i class="package">capt-of</i> or from the highly
sophisticated <i class="package">caption</i> package.

<p>
Using either method, you have to deal with the possibility of the
figure or table being too large for the page.  (Floating objects will
float away in this circumstance; &ldquo;doing it by hand&rdquo;, like this, you
take upon yourself the responsibility for avoiding 
&lsquo;[[[textit]]][[[LBRACE]]]Overfull <code>&#x5c;vbox</code>[[[RBRACE]]]&rsquo; errors.

<p>
A further problem is the possibility that such &ldquo;fixed floats&rdquo; will
overtake &ldquo;real floats&rdquo;, so that the numbers of figures will be out
of order: figure 6 could be on page 12, while figure 5 had floated to
page 13.  It&rsquo;s best, therefore, either to stay with floating figures
throughout a document, or to use fixed figures throughout.

<p>
If it&rsquo;s really impossible to follow that counsel of perfection, you
can use the <i class="package">perpage</i> package&rsquo;s command <code>&#x5c;MakeSorted</code>
command:
<blockquote>
<pre>
...
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{perpage}
\MakeSorted{figure}
\MakeSorted{table}
...
</pre>
</blockquote>
and the sequence of float numbers is all correct.
