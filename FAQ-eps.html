<h1>What is &ldquo;Encapsulated PostScript&rdquo; (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;)?</h1>


<p>

<p>
PostScript has been for many years a <em>lingua franca</em> of powerful
printers (though modern high-quality printers now tend to require some
constrained form of Adobe Acrobat, instead); since PostScript is also a
powerful graphical programming language, it is commonly used as an
output medium for drawing (and other) packages.

<p>
However, since PostScript <em>is</em> such a powerful language, some
rules need to be imposed, so that the output drawing may be included
in a document as a figure without &ldquo;leaking&rdquo; (and thereby destroying
the surrounding document, or failing to draw at all).

<p>
Appendix H of the PostScript Language Reference Manual (second
and subsequent editions), specifies a set of rules for PostScript to
be used as figures in this way.  The important features are:
<ul>
<li> certain &ldquo;structured comments&rdquo; are required; important ones are
  the identification of the file type, and information about the
  &ldquo;bounding box&rdquo; of the figure (i.e., the minimum rectangle
  enclosing it);
<li> some commands are forbidden&nbsp;&mdash; for example, a <tt>showpage</tt>
  command will cause the image to disappear, in most TeX-output
  environments; and
<li> &ldquo;preview information&rdquo; is permitted, for the benefit of things
  such as word processors that don&rsquo;t have the ability to draw
  PostScript in their own right&nbsp;&mdash; this preview information may be in
  any one of a number of system-specific formats, and any viewing
  program may choose to ignore it.
</ul>
A PostScript figure that conforms to these rules is said to be in
&ldquo;Encapsulated PostScript&rdquo; (EPS) format.  Most (La)TeX packages for
including PostScript are structured to use Encapsulated PostScript;
which of course leads to much hilarity as exasperated (La)TeX users
struggle to cope with the output of drawing software whose authors
don&rsquo;t know the rules.
