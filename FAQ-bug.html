<h1>What to do if you find a bug</h1>


<p>

<p>
For a start, make entirely sure you <em>have</em> found a bug.
Double-check with books about TeX, LaTeX, or whatever you&rsquo;re using;
compare what you&rsquo;re seeing against the other answers above; ask every
possible person you know who has any TeX-related expertise.
The reasons for all this caution are various.

<p>
If you&rsquo;ve found a bug in TeX itself, you&rsquo;re a rare animal indeed.
Don Knuth is so sure of the quality of his code that he offers real
money prizes to finders of bugs; the cheques he writes are
such rare items that they are seldom cashed. If <em>you</em>
think you have found a genuine fault in TeX itself (or MetaFont, or the
CM fonts, or the TeXbook), don&rsquo;t immediately write to Knuth,
however. He only looks at bugs infrequently, and even then
only after they are agreed as bugs by a small vetting team. In the
first instance, contact Barbara Beeton at the AMS
(<a href="mailto:bnb@ams.org">bnb@ams.org</a>), or contact
<a href="FAQ-TUG*.html">TUG</a>.

<p>
If you&rsquo;ve found a bug in LaTeX 2e, <a href="FAQ-latexbug.html">report it</a>
using mechanisms supplied by the LaTeX team.  (Please be
careful to ensure you&rsquo;ve got a LaTeX bug, or a bug in one of the
&ldquo;required&rdquo;  packages distributed by the LaTeX team.)

<p>
If you&rsquo;ve found a bug in a contributed LaTeX package, the best
starting place is usually to ask in the &ldquo;usual places for 
<a href="FAQ-gethelp.html">help on-line</a>, or just possibly one of the 
<a href="FAQ-maillists*.html">specialised mailing lists</a>.
The author of the package may well answer on-line, but if no-one
offers any help, you may stand a chance if you mail the author
(presuming that you can find an address&hellip;).

<p>
If you&rsquo;ve found a bug in LaTeX 2.09, or some other such unsupported
software, your only real hope is <a href="FAQ-gethelp.html">help on-line</a>.

<p>
Failing all else, you may need to pay for
help&nbsp;&mdash; TUG maintains a 
<a href="http://www.tug.org/consultants.html">register of TeX consultants</a>.
(This of course requires that you have the resources&nbsp;&mdash; and a
pressing  enough need&nbsp;&mdash; to hire someone.)
