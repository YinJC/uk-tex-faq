There is a wide range of symbols available for use with TeX, most
of which are not shown (or even mentioned) in (La)TeX books.
<em>The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List</em> (by Scott Pakin

<em>et al.</em>\@) illustrates over 2000 symbols, and details the
commands and the LaTeX packages needed to produce them.

<p>
However, while the symbol list is a wonderful resource, it is never
easy to find a particular symbol there.  A graphical 
<a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html.html">symbol search</a> is
available on the web.  The site provides you a scratch area on which
you draw the symbol you&rsquo;re thinking of, with your mouse; when you&rsquo;ve
finished drawing, the classifier tries to match your sketch with
symbols it knows about.  The matching process is pretty good, even for
the sketches of a <em>really</em> poor draughtsman (such as the present
author), and it&rsquo;s often worth trying more than once.  &lsquo;Detexify apps&rsquo;
are available for both Android and iPhone devices, you can use them to
draw the symbol with your fingertip&nbsp;&mdash; a less challenging procedure
than using your workstation&rsquo;s mouse, by all accounts!

<p>
If you are using Unicode maths in XeTeX or LuaTeX, your own
distribution ought to provide the Unicode maths symbol table
<i class="filename">unimath-symbols.pdf</i>; this lists the things available in the
commonly-used mathematics fonts.  (If the file isn&rsquo;t already available
on your system, you can download it from CTAN, where it live
with the <i class="package">unicode-math</i> package.
