# More than one sequence of footnotes

The need for more than one series of footnotes is common in critical
editions (and other literary criticism), but occasionally arises in
other areas.

Of course, the canonical critical edition package, [`edmac`](http://ctan.org/pkg/edmac),
offers the facility, as does its LaTeX port, the [`ledmac`](http://ctan.org/pkg/ledmac)
package.

Multiple ranges of footnotes are offered to LaTeX users by the
[`manyfoot`](http://ctan.org/pkg/manyfoot) package.  The package provides a fair array of
presentation options, as well.  Another critical edition
[`ednotes`](http://ctan.org/pkg/ednotes) package is built upon a basis that includes
[`manyfoot`](http://ctan.org/pkg/manyfoot), as its mechanism for multiple sets of footnotes.

The [`bigfoot`](http://ctan.org/pkg/bigfoot) package also uses [`manyfoot`](http://ctan.org/pkg/manyfoot) as part of
its highly sophisticated structure of footnote facilities, which was
also designed to support typesetting critical editions.
