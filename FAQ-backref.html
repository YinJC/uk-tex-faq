<h1>References from the bibliography to the citation</h1>


<p>

<p>
A link (or at least a page reference), from the bibliography to the
citing command, is often useful in large documents.

<p>
Two packages support this requirement, <i class="package">backref</i> and
<i class="package">citeref</i>.  <i class="package">Backref</i> is part of the
<i class="package">hyperref</i> bundle, and supports hyperlinks back to the citing
command.

<p>
<i class="package">Citeref</i> is the older, and seems to rely on rather simpler
(and therefore possibly more stable) code; it produces a list of page
references, only.  It doesn&rsquo;t interact well with other citation
packages (for example, <i class="package">cite</i>), which probably reflects its
antiquity (it&rsquo;s derived from a LaTeX 2.09 package).

<p>
Neither collapses
lists of pages (&ldquo;<tt>5, 6, 7</tt>&rdquo; comes out as such, rather than as
&ldquo;<tt>5&ndash;7</tt>&rdquo;), but neither package repeats the reference to a page that
holds multiple citations.  (The failure to collapse lists is of course
forgiveable in the case of the <i class="package">hyperref</i>-related
<i class="package">backref</i>, since the concept of multiple hyperlinks from the
same anchor is less than appealing.)
