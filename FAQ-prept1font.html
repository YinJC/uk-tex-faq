<h1>Preparing a Type&nbsp;1 font</h1>


<p>

<p>
The process of installing a Type&nbsp;1 font set is rather convoluted, and
we will deal with it in two chunks: first (in the present answer)
preparing the font for installation, and second 
<a href="FAQ-instt1font.html">installing a Type&nbsp;1 font</a>).

<p>
Many fonts are supplied in (La)TeX ready form: such fonts need no
preparation, and may be installed immediately.

<p>
However, if you purchase a font from a Type foundry (either direct or
via one of the web stores), you are likely to need to &lsquo;prepare&rsquo; it for
use with (La)TeX.  The rest of this answer discusses this preparation.
<ul>
<li> Acquire the font.  A very small set of Type&nbsp;1 fonts is installed
  in most PostScript printers you will encounter.  For those few (whose use
  is covered by the basic PSNFSS package), you don&rsquo;t need the
  Type&nbsp;1 font itself, to be able to print using the font.

<p>
  For all the myriad other Type&nbsp;1 fonts, to be able to print using
  the font you need the Type&nbsp;1 file itself.  Some of these are
  available for free (they&rsquo;ve either been donated to the public
  domain, or were developed as part of a free software project), but
  the vast majority are commercial products, requiring you to spend
  real money.
<li> Acquire the fonts&rsquo; AFM files.  AFM files contain
  information from the font foundry, about the sizes of the characters
  in the font, and how they fit together.  One measure of the quality
  of a font-supplier is that they provide the AFM files by
  default: if the files are not available, you are unlikely to be able
  to use the font with (La)TeX.
<li> Rename the AFM files and the Type&nbsp;1 files to match the
  <a href="FAQ-fontname.html">Berry font naming scheme</a>.
<li> Generate TeX metric files from the AFM files.  The
  commonest tool for this task is <i class="package">fontinst</i>; the package
  documentation helps, but other guides are available (see below).
  The simplest possible script to pass to <i class="package">fontinst</i> is:
  <blockquote>
<pre>
\latinfamily{xyz}{}
\bye
</pre>
  </blockquote>
  where <tt>xyz</tt> is the Berry name of the font family.  This
  simple script is adequate for most purposes: its output covers the
  font family in both T1 and OT1 font encodings.  Nevertheless,
  with fancier fonts, more elaborate things are possible with
  <i class="package">fontinst</i>: see its documentation for details.

<p>
  <i class="package">Fontinst</i> also generates map files, and LaTeX font
  definition (<code class="extension">fd</code>) files.
</ul>
Having traversed this list, you have a set of font files ready for
installation.
