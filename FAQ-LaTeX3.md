# The LaTeX project

The LaTeX project team (see [http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html])
is a small group of volunteers whose aim is
to produce a major new document processing system based on the
principles pioneered by Leslie Lamport in the current LaTeX.  The
new system is (provisionally) called LaTeX3; it
will remain freely available and it will be fully documented at
all levels.

The LaTeX team's first product (LaTeX 2e) was delivered in 1994
(it's now properly called ''LaTeX'', since no other version is current).

LaTeX 2e was intended as a consolidation exercise, unifying several
sub-variants of LaTeX while changing nothing whose change wasn't
absolutely necessary.  This has permitted the team to support a single
version of LaTeX, in parallel with development of LaTeX3.

Some of the older discussion papers about directions for LaTeX3 are
to be found on CTAN; other (published) articles are to be found
on the project web site ([http://www.latex-project.org/papers/]).

Some of the project's experimental code is visible on the net:
  

-  via [http://www.latex-project.org/code.html], which points
    to the project's SVN repository;
-  via the project's
    [_GitHub_ mirror](https://github.com/latex3/svn-mirror);
-  from CTAN: snapshots of two major collections from the
    code, [`l3kernel`](http://ctan.org/pkg/l3kernel) (supporting LaTeX3 coding conventions in
    a LaTeX 2e environment), [`l3packages`](http://ctan.org/pkg/l3packages) (a first cut of a
    ''document designer's interface'') as well as
    [`l3experimental`](http://ctan.org/pkg/l3experimental) (new stuff that's still under
    development).

The packages [`l3kernel`](http://ctan.org/pkg/l3kernel) and [`l3packages`](http://ctan.org/pkg/l3packages) provide an
''experimental harness'' that may be used as a testbed for LaTeX3
work.

Note that [`l3kernel`](http://ctan.org/pkg/l3kernel) introduces a coding structure quite
different from earlier LaTeX code; a few hardy authors, who are not
members of the project, are nevertheless using it in their development
work.

Anyone may participate in discussions of the future of LaTeX
through the mailing list `latex-l`; some development work
(outside the project) is discussed on the list.  Subscribe to the list
