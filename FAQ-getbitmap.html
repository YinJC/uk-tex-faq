<h1>Acquiring bitmap fonts</h1>


<p>

<p>
When CTAN was young, most people would start using TeX
with a 300 dots-per-inch (dpi) laser printer, and sets of Computer
Modern bitmap fonts for this resolution are available on CTAN.
(There are separate sets for write-black and write-white printers, as
well as sets at 120&nbsp;dpi and 240&nbsp;dpi.)

<p>
There used to regular requests that CTAN should hold
a wider range of resolutions, but they were resisted for two reasons:
<ul>
<li> The need to decide which printers to generate fonts for.  The
  broad-brush approach taken for 300&nbsp;dpi printers was (more or less)
  justified back then, given the dominance of certain printer
  &lsquo;engines&rsquo;, but nowadays one could not make any such assumption.
<li> Given the above, it has been near-impossible to justify the
  space that would be required by a huge array of bitmap fonts.
</ul>
Fortunately, (La)TeX distribution technology has put a stop to these
arguments: most (if not all) current distributions generate bitmap
fonts as needed, and cache them for later re-use.  The impatient
user, who is determined that all bitmap fonts should be created once
and for all, may be supported by scripts such as <i class="progname">allcm</i>
(distributed with texlive, at least; otherwise such a
person should consult &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-useMF.html">the use of MetaFont</a>)&rdquo;.

<p>
If your output is to a PostScript-capable device, or if your output is
destined to be converted to PDF, you should switch to
using Type&nbsp;1 versions of the CM fonts.  Two free
sets are available; the older (<i class="package">bakoma</i>) is
somewhat less well produced than the <i class="package">bluesky</i> fonts, which were
originally professionally produced and sold, but were then released
for general public use by their originators Y&amp;Y and Bluesky Research,
in association with the AMS and other scientific publishers
(they are nowadays available under the SIL&rsquo;s Open Fonts Licence).  The
two sets contain slightly different ranges of fonts, but you are
advised to use the <i class="package">bluesky</i> set except when <i class="package">bakoma</i>
is for some reason absolutely unavoidable.  In recent years, several
other &lsquo;MetaFont&rsquo; fonts have been converted to Type&nbsp;1 format; it&rsquo;s
uncommon ever to need to generate bitmap fonts for any purpose other
than previewing&nbsp;&mdash; see 
<a href="FAQ-PSpreview.html">&ldquo;previewing documents with Type&nbsp;1 fonts&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;&mdash;
if even then.

<p>
More modern fonts may be used in place of the Computer Modern set.  The
<a href="FAQ-ECfonts.html">EC fonts</a> and the 
<a href="FAQ-uselmfonts.html">Latin Modern fonts</a> are both close relatives with
wider ranges of glyphs to offer.
